Abstract. Mobile search market is growing very fast. Mining mobile
search activities is helpful for understanding user preference, interest and
even regular patterns. In previous works, text information contained by
either search queries or web pages visited by users is well studied to
mine search activities. Since rich context information (e.g., time, loca-
tion and other sensor inputs) is contained in the mobile search data, it
has also been leveraged by researchers for mining user activities. How-
ever, the two types of information were used separately. In this paper,
we propose a graphical model approach, namely the Text and Context-
based User Activity Model (TCUAM), which mines user activity patterns
by utilizing query text and context simultaneously. The model is devel-
oped based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by regarding users’
activities as latent topics. In order to guide the activity mining pro-
cess, we borrow some external knowledge of topic-word relationship to
build a constrained TCUAM model. The experimental results indicate
that the TCUAM model yields better results compared with text-only
and context-only approaches. We also ﬁnd that the constrained TCUAM
model is more eﬀective than the unconstrained TCUAM model.

Keywords: mobile user modeling, user’s activity mining, Latent Dirich-
let Allocation.

Introduction

With the prosperity of mobile market, more and more web search activities go to
mobile devices. This raises the requirement of mining mobile search data, which
is important for understanding user preferences, interests and activity patterns.
Compared with web search from PC, mobile search data contains rich context
information, e.g., time, location, surrounding business and other signals captured
by sensors of mobile devices. Previous works of mining search activities focus on
analyzing the content of search query, web pages, etc., with limited attentions of
mining context information [3]. According to our analysis of mobile search log

(cid:2) This work was done when the ﬁrst two authors conducted internship at Microsoft

Research Asia.

data, we discover that both search query text and context information can help
understand user activities. Table 1 gives examples of three major types of user
search activities.

– Text-Dominated activities can be fully understood by query content, with-
out considering context information. For example, query “restaurant” indi-
cates that the user wants to ﬁnd a restaurant.

– Context-Dominated activities can be explained by the context informa-
tion. E.g., a user issues several queries with the following context: “Time =
14:00∼15:00”, “Day = Sunday” and “SurroundingType = Baseball Clubs
& Parks”. We can infer that the user’s activity may be related to “Playing
Baseball”.

– Both-Dependent activities require both text and context information to
explain the user’s activities. For instance, the user’s context is “Time =
15:00∼16:00”, “Day = Saturday”, “SurroundingType = Downtown”, and
the query is “Samsung focus price Amazon.com”. We can infer that the
user’s activity is likely to be “Shopping”.

We can see that both text and context information can help understand the
activity of mobile users. However, as far as we know, currently there are few ap-
proaches which can model user activities based on text and context information
simultaneously.

In this paper, we propose a graphical model approach, namely the Text and
Context-based User Activity Model (TCUAM) to mine user activity patterns
using both query text and search context information. The TCUAM model is
developed based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), by regarding user ac-
tivities as latent topics. As there are many noises in mobile log data, TCUAM
has diﬃculty in discovering meaningful patterns. Therefore, we leverage human
knowledge to help. We borrow external knowledge of topic-word relationship
to build a constrained TCUAM model. The experiments on real mobile log in-
dicates that the TCUAM model yields better results compared with text-only
and context-only approaches. We also ﬁnd that the constrained TCUAM model
behaves more eﬀectively than the unconstrained TCUAM model.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy introduces the
related work. The TCUAM model is deﬁned in Section 3. We describe experi-
ments and results in Section 4. Conclusions are given in Section 5.

2 Related Work

There are mainly two groups of research works which are related to ours. The
ﬁrst is about feature modeling used in mining user activity patterns. Understand-
ing user intent from text information such as past queries and user proﬁles is a
common technique for web search personalization. Sieg et al. [2] analyzed user
proﬁles and assigned implicitly derived interest scores to existing concepts in a
domain ontology for personalization. Noll et al. [4] implemented personalization
using social bookmarking and tagging. Teevan et al. [5] utilized a personaliza-
tion technique to leverage implicit information about the users’ interests and
activities, including previously issued queries, previously visited web pages and
the documents a user has read or created. Besides text information mentioned
above, context information is also adopted by researchers to mine user activity
patterns. Arias et al. [6] found that it was beneﬁcial to understand user intents
and complete desired queries by context information such as time and location.
Hattori et al. [7] improved the performance of query reﬁnement by incorporating
user context information. Church et al. [8] proposed a novel interface to support
multi-dimensional and context-sensitive mobile search, combining context fea-
tures such as location, time, and community preferences to oﬀer better search
experiences.

The other group of related works is about learning models. The models of
utilizing context information can be divided into three stages. In the ﬁrst stage,
context information is manually processed in a certain domain, especially in
a geographical system [9,10,11]. In the second stage, researchers begin to use
traditional text learning model to tackle context learning problems. Algorithms
like Bayesian Network, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) have been adopted to model user
behaviors [12,13]. In the third stage, unsupervised models are used for learning
tasks of large-scale data. Topic model related approaches are adopted in this
stage for user activity mining. E.g., Bao et al. [3] tried to model context infor-
mation by an unsupervised approach based on latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)
to discover users’ activities.

3 Methodology

3.1 Data and Preprocessing

In this work, we mine user activities using mobile search log. The log contains a

set of records R = {r1, r2...rn}, where ri =< qi, ci >. qi is the query issued by the

112

B. Peng et al.

user and ci is the context when the search event happens. ci = {< fi, vi > |1 ≤
i ≤ Np} where < fi, vi > is a feature-value pair, fi stands for the feature name
while vi is the value of feature fi. As we know, there are various noises in search
log and it is diﬃcult to obtain satisfactory results without data preprocessing.
In traditional approaches, queries with low frequencies are usually regarded as
noises and excluded from query log. In our work, we regard the queries which
are not very related to context as noises. We introduce a scoring function to
calculate the possibility of a query to be noise:

(cid:2)Np

ξ(q) = −

i=1 p(< fi, vi >)log(p(< fi, vi >))

|fq − ˜f75%|

(1)

where p(< fi, vi >) stands for the probability of feature fi to take the value
vi. The smaller value − (cid:2)Nf
i=1 p(< fi, vi >)log(p(< fi, vi >)) takes, the more
irrelevant feature fi is with the query text, thus the more likely query q will be
˜f75% stands for the average
a noisy query. fq denotes the frequency of query q,
frequency of 75% queries whose values lie in the middle of all the queries. The
larger value |fq − ˜f75%| takes, the more extreme the query frequency is, thus the

more likely the query is considered to be noise.

The smaller value ξ(q) takes, the more likely that query q is considered as
noise. In practice, an appropriate threshold is chosen to ﬁlter out noisy queries.

3.2 Text and Context-Based User Activity Model

In this section, we will introduce the Text and Context-based User Activity
Model (TCUAM) for mining users’ activities based on Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA). Bao et al.
[3] has proposed an LDA-based approach to mine user
activities using context information. However, context information itself can only
explain part of user activities. Our model is designed to utilize text and context
information simultaneously for user activity mining.

Given a set of records R = {r1, r2...rn}, we split them into sessions according
span. Given a collection of M sessions S = {s1, s2..., sM}, we assume that each

to time information. Each session contains data records within 30-minutes time

session is generated by a collection of topics, which follow dirichlet distributions.
Suppose there are totally K topics, rm,n =< qm,n, cm,n > denotes the nth ob-
servation of record in the mth session. qm,n = {wm,n,1, wm,n,2, ...} stands for the
nth observation of query text in the mth session where wm,n,i is the ith word
of query qm,n, cm,n = {< fi, vi >} stands for the nth observation of context in
the mth session. < fi, vi > represents a feature-value pair where fi denotes the
feature name and vi denotes the value of feature fi.

The process of generating text and context information for all the sessions
can be expressed as follows. Firstly, draw a query word distribution ϕk for
each topic k from dirichlet distribution with parameter β. Secondly, for each
topic k and feature f , draw a feature-value pair distribution ωk·f from dirichlet

Mining Mobile Users’ Activities Based on Search Query Text and Context

113

distribution with parameter τ . Thirdly, for each session sm, draw a topic distribu-
tion θm and a feature distributions λm from dirichlet distribution with parameter
α and γ respectively. Then for each session sm, records are generated repeatedly
based on the model. For each record rm,n in session sm, we ﬁrst choose a topic
zm,n according to the topic distribution Multi(θm). Afterwards, query text and
context information are generated respectively according to their distributions
on topic zm,n. Each word wm,n,i in the query text is generated directly from word
distribution M ulti(ϕzi,j ). For the context cm,n = {< fi, vi >}, each feature fi
is generated from the feature distribution M ulti(λm) while the corresponding
value vi is generated from the feature-value pair distribution M ulti(ωzi,j,fi).
Table 2 summarizes the generative process of TCUAM.

In practice, we take the whole query as a single word. That is, we use qm,n =

wm,n, instead of qm,n = {wm,n,1, wm,n,2, ...}. The graphical representation of the

model is shown in Figure 1.

(2) Generate query text qm,n:

For each feature value pair < fi, vi > in cm,n,
(i) Choose a feature fi ∼ Multi(λm,zi,j )
(ii) Choose a feature value vi ∼ Multi(ωzi,j ,fi )

3.3 Inference of Model

To simplify the equations, we deﬁne the following symbols. The hyper-parameters
in the TCUAM model are denoted as Θ, which include α, β, γ and τ . The ob-
servations are denoted by Γ , which consist of Ns sessions. rm,n =< qm,n, cm,n >
denotes the nth record in the mth session. qm,n = wm,n stands for the nth ob-
servation of query text in the mth session, and cm,n = {< fi, vi > |1 ≤ i ≤ Np}
stands for the nth observation of context in the mth session. < fi, vi > represents
a feature-value pair where fi denotes the feature name and vi denotes the value of
feature fi. The parameters are represented by Δ, including θ, ϕ, λ and ω. The la-
tent variables of topics are denoted by z. We deﬁne Φ = {ϕk}K
and Ω = {ωp}K·F

k=1, Λ = {λk}K
k=1
p=1 , where K is the total number of topics and F is the total

number of features. Thus, given hyper-parameters, the joint distribution of all
observations and hidden variables can be calculated as follows:

Ns(cid:3)

Nr(cid:3)

p(Γ, Δ, z|Θ) =

p(vp|ωzm,n,fj )
× p(fp|λm,zm,n )p(zm,n|θm)p(θm|α)p(Φ|β)p(Λ|γ)p(Ω|τ )

p(wm,n|ϕzm,n )

Np(cid:3)

(2)

where Ns is the number of sessions, Nr is the number of records in each session,
and Np is the number of feature-value pairs in the context.

We obtain the joint probability for all observations by integrating over the

parameters and latent variables:

(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)

We use Gibbs sampling to get the approximate estimation of parameters. In
Gibbs sampling, each record is assigned to a certain topic under the condition
that other records have been labeled. We assume that Text Information and
Context Information are generated by activity topics independently and obtain
the following equation:

p(zi = k|z¬i, w, c) = p(zi = k|z¬i, w, )p(zi = k|z¬i, c)

(4)

where w stands for the vector of words; c stands for the vector of feature-value
pairs in the context; zi represents the topic of the ith record whereas z¬i denotes
the vector of topics for all records after excluding the ith record.

The two conditional probabilities on the right side of Eq.(4) can be calculated

by [14]:

p(zi = k|z¬i, w) =

3.4 Constrained TCUAM Model

In practice, the unconstrained TCUAM model is unable to achieve satisfactory
results due to massive noises in mobile log. Therefore, we borrow some external
knowledge about topic-word relationship to help. We leverage a set of websites,
which are organized into a list of topics. For each topic, we can use search log
to associate queries with websites using the follow-click information. Given a

set of topics K = {k1, k2...}, assume that the set of websites for topic ki is
url(ki) = {u1, u2...}. Suppose there is a set of queries Q = {q1, q2...} and the

116

B. Peng et al.

set of follow-click URLs for each query qj is f click(qj) = {u1, u2...}. We split

each query into word sequences. Thus, the relevant score of topic ki and word
wj can be calculated by:

(cid:5)

Score(ki, wj ) =

wj qt ,u(cid:2)f click(qt),u(cid:2)url(ki)

tf idfwj

(11)

We choose top 50 words with the highest relevance scores for each topic and map
them to η[50 ∼ 1] linearly. For example, if airline is the third relevant word to
topic Travel, η(T ravel, airline) = 48. Thus, we obtain 50 representative words
for each topic as external knowledge to guide the activity mining model. The
core idea of using this knowledge is to increase the weight of an unlabeled word
in Gibbs Sampling if it is known to be a representative word for a speciﬁc topic.
The whole procedure of Gibbs sampling is displayed in Algorithm 1, where the
variables are deﬁned in Table 3.

4 Experiment

4.1 Data Set

In this paper, we carry out our experiments on real mobile logs from a commercial
search engine. The data set consists of half a year’s mobile logs in California
State, USA. Table 4 shows the feature list of text and context information used
in our experiment. For period feature, we deﬁne its values according to the time
range of search activity. We remove the users whose query numbers are less than
50 in half a year time span. The preprocessing procedure described in section
3.1 is applied to clean the dataset. In our experiment, we set the threshold as
0.25.

The external knowledge of topic-word relationship for the constrained TCUAM
model is illustrated in Table 5. We have 15 kinds of activity topics which mobile
users are specially interested in. For each activity topic, 50 words are selected to
be the external knowledge. Because of space limitation, only top 5 words for each
activity topic are listed in the table.

4.2 Experimental Setup

In the experiment, we evaluate four models which are described below.

– TM (Text-based Model) is the baseline of our experiment. The text-based
model utilizes query text to build a LDA model for mining users’ activities.
– CM (Context-based Model) is proposed by Bao et al. [3] to mine mobile

users’ activity patterns based on context information.

– TCUAM (Text and Context-based User Activity Model) is an unconstrained
approach proposed in this paper to model users’ activities by using text and
context information collaboratively.

– CTCUAM (Constrained TCUAM) is a constrained model which uses ex-

ternal knowledge of topic-word relationship to guide the TCUAM model.

In order to get a fair comparison of the models above, we adopt the same session
segmentation method for all the models. Records are segmented into sessions
by time information. Each session contains the records within a time span of
30 minutes. In addition, the number of topics in all the models is set to be 200
experimentally.

The goal of our experiment is to examine whether users’ activity patterns can be
mined correctly from mobile logs. Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to identify auto-
matically whether the result patterns make sense or not. Therefore, we examine
the result topics produced by each model manually and assign each topic a score.
The score is given according to the following rules:

– 5: It is a perfect pattern and indicates user activity clearly.
– 4: It is a good pattern and can give an overall sense of user activity.
– 3: It is a reasonable pattern and gives some clues of the user activity.
– 2: It is a bad pattern and includes many noises.
– 1: It is a non-sense pattern and diﬃcult to be understood.

The average score (AS) of result topics is calculated after each topic is assigned
a score manually. In our experiment, we use AS as the metric to evaluate the
performances of diﬀerent models.

4.4 Results

Table 6 shows the results of diﬀerent models, evaluated by the average score
(AS). We can ﬁnd out that the worst way to mine user’s activity is the Context-
based Model (CM), whose AS value is 1.995. It indicates that only context
information is not enough to determine users’ actual activities. The Text-based
Model (TM) achieves 2.295 for AS value, which shows that the text informa-
tion is more informative than the context information. By using text and context
information simultaneously, the TCUAM model achieves 2.545 for AS value (im-
proving 27.6% from Context-based Model and 10.9% from Text-based Model).
Therefore, the text information and context information can be utilized collab-
oratively to beneﬁt the activity mining approaches. The Constrained TCUAM
model enhances the performance further by 11.8%, achieving an AS value of
2.845. Moreover, the knowledge used in the constrained model is easy to be col-
lected. Thus, the constrained model can mine user activity topics more precisely
without taking too much human eﬀorts.

4.5 Case Study

To get a further understanding of the Constrained TCUAM model, we select
some examples to demonstrate the results produced by the model. Table 7 shows

two topics discovered by the model. The “IsRelevant” column gives the human
judgement that whether the text or context is relevant to the topic. It is easy
to infer that the user’s activity is “searching for stock information at home in
the workday morning” for the left case and it is “searching for amusement place
after dinner outside in the weekend” for the right case.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a text and context-based user activity model to mine
user’s activity patterns from mobile logs. In addition, we introduce a small
amount of external knowledge about topic-word relationship to build a con-
strained TCUAM model. The experiments were carried out on real mobile logs.
The experimental results have indicated that the TCUAM model can yield bet-
ter results, compared with text-only and context-only approaches. We can also
conclude from the results that the constrained TCUAM model performs more
eﬀectively than the unconstrained TCUAM model.
