Abstract. Given a budget and a network where different nodes have different
costs to be selected, the budgeted inﬂuence maximization is to select seeds on
budget so that the number of ﬁnal inﬂuenced nodes can be maximized. In this
paper, we propose three strategies to solve this problem. First, Billboard strat-
egy chooses the most inﬂuential nodes as the seeds. Second, Handbill strategy
chooses the most cost-effective nodes as the seeds. Finally, Combination strategy
chooses the “best” seeds from two “better” seed sets obtained from the former
two strategies. Experiments show that Billboard strategy and Handbill strategy
can obtain good solution efﬁciently. Combination strategy is the best algorithm
or matches the best algorithm in terms of both accuracy and efﬁciency, and it is
more balanced than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

1 Introduction

Inﬂuence maximization is a hot topic for viral marketing and has been heavily studied
in the previous literature [5,3,4]. The traditional problem statement is to ﬁnd a k-node
set of seeds that propagate inﬂuence so that the number of resulting inﬂuenced nodes
can be maximized. This deﬁnition is proposed by Kempe at al. [5] and implies an as-
sumption that each node has an uniform cost to be chosen. Following his work, most of
the existing works comply with the same assumption and focus on the k-node inﬂuence
maximization problem [11,3,4]. However, this assumption does not accord with most
real-world scenarios. For example, in the domain of online advertising service, different
web sites have different advertising prices. If a company promotes its product by online
advertisement, how to choose the web sites on budget? Spend much money on some
few famous portal sites or choose less popular web sites to add the number of adver-
tisements? Obviously, this problem is different from k-node inﬂuence maximization.

The problem statement of inﬂuence maximization can be extended to a generalized
form. Given a social network where nodes may have different costs to be selected,
an inﬂuence diffusion model and a budget, inﬂuence maximization is to ﬁnd a seed
set within the budget that maximizes the number of ﬁnal inﬂuenced nodes. Nguyen et
al. [10] call this problem budgeted inﬂuence maximization(BIM). In mathematics, k-
node inﬂuence maximization and budgeted inﬂuence maximization have two different
mathematical abstractions [8,6]. And it has been proved that the algorithms for the

former will no longer produce satisfactory solutions for the latter [6]. Thus, most of the
existing approaches for k-node inﬂuence maximization do not suit for the BIM problem.
The other challenge to inﬂuence maximization is the efﬁciency. A common method
to this problem is Greedy algorithm [5], which does well in accuracy but has a bad
performance in efﬁciency. Some researchers adopt different ideas to address this prob-
lem efﬁciently [3,2,4]. However, either they improve the efﬁciency at the cost of ef-
fectiveness, or the proposed approach can only address k-node inﬂuence maximization
problem. To our knowledge, there are only two existing studies focusing on budgeted
inﬂuence maximization [7,10], and both of them are based on Greedy algorithm. Al-
though these studies concentrate on improving Greedy algorithm to reduce the runtime,
they still can not overcome its intrinsic ﬂaw of expensive computation.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of budgeted inﬂuence maximization and aim to
propose an approach that has good performance in both accuracy and efﬁciency. We
ﬁrst analyze real networks empirically, including deﬁning node roles and studying seed
selection heuristics, which is the foundation of the proposed algorithm. Then, we ad-
vance three strategies to address this problem. The ﬁrst one is Billboard strategy that
chooses the most inﬂuential nodes as the seeds. The second one is Handbill strategy that
chooses the most cost-effectvie nodes as the seeds. And the third one, called Combina-
tion strategy, uses Simulated Annealing to choose the best combination of nodes from
the two nonoverlapping sets resulting from the previous two strategies. Experiments
show that Billboard strategy and Handbill strategy can solve this problem efﬁciently
and obtain good accuracies. Combination strategy is the best algorithm or matches the
best algorithm in terms of both accuracy and efﬁciency, and is more balanced than the
state-of-the-art algorithms.

2 Problem Statement and Preliminaries

2.1 Problem Statement

A social network can be modeled as a graph G = (V, E), where vertices v represent
individuals and edges E represent the relationship between two individuals, each vertice
v ∈ V has a cost c(v) denoting the expense when it is selected. A diffusion model
describes the spread of an information through the social network G. In this paper, we
adopt Independent Cascade(IC) model for simulating inﬂuence propagation, which is
a classical information propagation model and is widely used in the previous inﬂuence
maximization research [5,7,4]. Given a network G, a diffusion model and a budget B,
budgeted inﬂuence maximization is to ﬁnd a seed set S ∈ V such that subjecting to the
v∈S c(v) ≤ B, the number of ﬁnal inﬂuenced individuals σ(S) can
budget constraint
be maximized. The important notations used in this paper are declared in Table 1.

2.2 Billboards and Handbills

There are two natural ideas commonly used to select seeds for the BIM problem in the
real-life scenario. In this paper, we call them Billboard strategy and Handbill strategy.
Billboard strategy is to choose the most inﬂuential nodes as seeds in the network. We
call these nodes billboards, because they are like billboard advertisements that are lo-
cated in high trafﬁc area and can create the most impactful visibility to people. Handbill
strategy is to choose the low-cost nodes as seeds. We call them handbills, because hand-
bills are inexpensive to produce but can be distributed to a large number of individuals.
The two strategies select seeds from two different kinds of node candidates. They are
billboard nodes and handbill nodes. In this paper, we distinguish them according to the
degree. Since most real networks have scale-free property [1], we could adopt Pareto
principle to distinguish between billboards and handbills, that is, the top 20% of nodes
with the largest degree can be deﬁned as billboards and the remainders are handbills.
Fig.1 is a degree Pareto chart for a citation network (called HEP-PH network and its
description is given in Section 4.1). From the chart, the degree distribution has a long
tail and ﬁts Pareto’s law. The border degree for this network is 19, that is, the nodes
whose degree is larger than 19 are billboards and the others are handbills.

2.3 Node Roles

A node role is a characterization of the part it plays in a network structure [11]. Nodes
with different degrees or in different locations can be assigned different roles for de-
scribing their abilities to inﬂuence propagation. In our study, we ﬁrst abstract four typi-
cal topologies from real networks, which are the basic structures to compose a network.
They are respectively multi-cluster, single cluster, chain and loner, shown in Fig.2. Ob-
serving the nodes in these topologies, we deﬁne six roles to characterize different kinds
of nodes, and they can cover all the nodes in the network. The deﬁnitions are follows.
– King. King is a global hub node in a multi-cluster topology, providing connections
to many local communities. It has a wide inﬂuence by two characteristics. Firstly,
it is a high-degree node that can inﬂuence many nodes directly. Secondly, many of
its neighbors are also high-degree nodes. The inﬂuence can further propagate by
the inﬂuential neighbors indirectly. In Fig.2, node a is a king node.

68

S. Han et al.

– Seignior. Seignior is a hub node in a local community. It is also a high-degree node.
However, comparing with the king, it does not have that many inﬂuential neighbors
and its inﬂuence is limited to a local region. In Fig.2, node b is a seignior.

– Butterﬂy. We call a node butterﬂy from the word “butterﬂy effect” meaning that a
low-degree node can have wide inﬂuence by activating its inﬂuential neighbors. For
example, in Twitter network, once a grassroot’s tweet is forwarded by a celebrity,
it will be popular explosively. In Fig.2, node c is a butterﬂy.

– Leaf. Leaf is the end of a communication chain. In Fig.2, node f is a leaf node. It

only accepts information from spreaders, but can not further transmit it to others.

– Loner. Loner is an isolated node that has no connections with others, shown as

node g in Fig.2.

– Civilian. Except for the above ﬁve types of nodes, the remaining nodes of a network
can be categorized as civilians. Civilian nodes have no particular characteristics for
inﬂuence propagation. In Fig.2, node e is a civilian.

Based on the above description, we distinguish the roles by quantiﬁcation. We de-
ﬁne kings and seigniors as billboard nodes, which have the top 20% largest degree in
the network, and the other four roles are handbill nodes. We distinguish kings from
seigniors by calculating the ratio of the sum of a node’s neighbors’ degree to its own
degree and comparing it with a threshold. If the ratio is larger than a threshold, it is a
king, otherwise, it is a seignior. For the four handbill roles, if a node’s neighbors contain
billboard nodes, we call it butterﬂy. If a node has precursors but has no followers, we
call it leaf. If a node has neither precursors nor followers, we call it loner. Except for
the ﬁve roles, the remaining nodes of a network are called civilians.

3 The Proposed Methods

In this paper, we propose three strategies to address the BIM problem. They are Billboard
strategy, Handbill strategy and Combination strategy. Before designing algorithms, we
ﬁrst investigate seed selection heuristics through experimental analysis, which provides
the basis for the proposed algorithms.

3.1 Seed Selection Heuristics

An commonly used method for the BIM problem is Modiﬁed Greedy algorithm [7,10].
In this section, we compute the seed set with Modiﬁed Greedy algorithm and obtain
some heuristics from the seeds, which are the foundation of the proposed algorithms.

Firstly, we calculate the proportion of each role in a real network according to the
role deﬁnition. The statistical result of a citation network (HEP-PH) is shown in Table 2.

Seignior Butterﬂy
0.1652

Civilian

Then, we compute the seeds with Modiﬁed Greedy algorithm and calculate the pro-
portion of each role in the seed set. The basic idea of Modiﬁed Greedy algorithm is
to compute the solutions by using two different heuristics and return the better one as

the result. Consequently, we can get two seed sets and each set is computed by one
heuristic. The ﬁrst heuristic is the basic greedy heuristic:

σ(Sk−1 ∪ v) − σ(Sk−1),

vk = argmax
v∈V \Sk−1

(1)
where vk is the target seed in step k, Sk−1 is the seed set in step k − 1, and σ(Sk−1) is
the inﬂuence of seed set Sk−1. We perform the Greedy algorithm on HEP-PH network
and calculate the proportion of each role in the seed set. The result is shown in Table 3.
The second heuristic takes cost into account and choose the most cost-effective nodes

as the seeds.

vk = argmax
v∈V \Sk−1

σ(Sk−1 ∪ v) − σ(Sk−1)

c(v)

,

(2)

where c(v) is the cost of node v. The proportion of each role in the seeds computed by
this heuristic is shown as Table 4.

From the above calculations, we can obtain two heuristic methods. The ﬁrst one
is role heuristic. Comparing Table 3 with Table 2, we could ﬁnd that although there
are very few king nodes in the network, they account for a large percentage in the
seed set obtained by basic greedy heuristic. The basic greedy heuristic chooses the
most inﬂuential seeds in the network, which is in accord with Billboard strategy. Then,
the approach of Billboard strategy should distinguish kings from seigniors. Comparing
Table 4 with Table 2, we could ﬁnd that when we take cost into account, the butterﬂy
node has more advantage than the other roles in inﬂuence propagation. Since, Handbill
strategy is to choose the most cost-effective nodes as the seeds, the approach of Handbill
strategy should distinguish butterﬂy from other roles.

The second heuristic method is distance heuristic. We measure the distance between
each pair of the selected seeds, that is the length of the shortest path form a seed to
another one. The average distance of HEP-PH network is larger than 2. Thus, in the
proposed algorithms, we do not choose the nodes whose neighbors have already existed
in the seed set, which can avoid the overlap of the seeds’ inﬂuence.

In our study, we also do the same analyses on three other networks (their descriptions
are declared in Section 4.1) and obtain similar conclusions. Due to the space limitation,
we do not show the analysis results here.

3.2 Billboard Strategy

Billboard strategy is the idea that chooses the most inﬂuential nodes in the network as
the seeds. For example, companies put advertisements on major media and products are
endorsed by celebrities, both of the marketing actions are Billboard strategy.

We have deﬁned that Billboard strategy chooses seeds from billboard nodes, whose
roles are kings and seigniors. And according to the role heuristic, the proposed approach
of Billboard strategy should distinguish kings from seigniors. The distinguishing char-
acteristic of kings from seigniors is that not only king nodes themselves but also most
of their neighbors are high-degree nodes. It implies that when we evaluate the inﬂuence
of a node, we need to consider its neighbors’ abilities to inﬂuence propagation. Then,
evaluating a node’s inﬂuence can be converted as calculating the expected number of
inﬂuenced nodes in its two-hop area.
Theorem 1. Given a social network G = (V, E) and the IC model with a small propa-
gation probability p, let N (u) = {v|v ∈ V, eu,v ∈ E} be the out-neighbors of node u,
outD(v) be the out-degree of node v. The expected number of inﬂuenced nodes in seed
u’s two-hop area is estimated by

Fig. 3. The Topology of a Seed’s Two-hop Area

Proof. Firstly, We consider a simple situation that there are no connections between the
nodes in a seed’s two-hop area, shown as Fig.3(a). Suppose node u is the seed, node
vi ∈ N (u) is the seed’s neighbor, and node wj ∈ {w|w ∈ N (vi), vi ∈ N (u)} is the
seed’s neighbor’s neighbor. The probability that node vi is inﬂuenced by seed u is p and
the probability that node wj is inﬂuenced by seed u is p2. Then, the expected number
of inﬂuenced nodes in seed u’s two-hop area can be deﬁned as:

(cid:3)

1 +

v∈N (u)

(1 + outD(v) · p) · p,

(4)

where outD(v) is the out-degree of node v. In this deﬁnition, 1 means node u itself,
v∈N (u)(1 + outD(v) · p) · p means the number of the
that is sure to be activated, and
potentially inﬂuenced nodes in its neighbors and neighbors’ neighbors.

(cid:2)

Balanced Seed Selection for BIM in Social Networks

71

However, real-world networks usually have many tightly-knit groups that are char-
acterized by a high density of ties [12], shown as Fig.3(b). In this situation, Formula (4)
can not estimate a seed’s inﬂuence accurately. For example, suppose that there are m
edges connecting from node vi(i (cid:5)= 2) to node v2. In the correct calculation, the proba-
bility pu,v2 that node v2 is inﬂuenced by node u is:
pu,v2 = 1 − (1 − p)(1 − p2)m

= 1 − (1 − p)[1 − mp2 + C2
= p + mp2 − mp3 + o(p3).

mp4 + o(p4)]

Suppose that there are n edges connecting from vi to node w5. In the correct calculation,
the probability pu,w5 that node w5 is inﬂuenced by node u is:

pu,w5 = 1 − (1 − p2)n

= 1 − [1 − np2 + C2
= np2 + o(p3).

np4 + o(p4)]

Since the propagation probability p is usually very small, we can ignore o(p3).

However, in formula (4), we calculate the probability pu,v2 as p + mp2, since the
probability that node v2 is directly inﬂuenced by seed u is p and indirectly inﬂuenced by
the m neighbors is mp2. And we calculate the probability pu,w5 as np2, since node w5
is indirectly inﬂuenced by the n neighbors. Comparing this calculation with the above
derivation, for each edge e ∈ {evi,vj|evi,vj ∈ E, vi ∈ N (u), vj ∈ N (u)}, Formula (4)
should minus p3. Then, we can get Formula (3).

From the above, the algorithm of Billboard strategy can be stated as follows. We only
take billboards that are the top 20% nodes with the largest degree in the network as the
candidates for seed selection, and calculate their abilities to inﬂuence propagation by
Formula (3). We in turn select the next best candidate with the largest ability value as
the seed until the budget is exhaust. Based on the distance heuristic, when choosing a
seed, we would judge whether its neighbors have already existed in the seed set. If not
yet, we will choose it, otherwise, we will ignore it and take the next one.

3.3 Handbill Strategy

Handbill strategy is the idea that chooses the most cost-effective nodes as the seeds.
In the real world, advertisers, limiting each location’s cost to increase the advertising
locations, can also broaden the awareness of product.

We have deﬁned that Handbill strategy chooses seeds from handbill nodes, whose
roles are butterﬂy, leaf, loner and civilian. And according to the role heuristic, the pro-
posed approach of Handbill strategy should prioritize butterﬂy nodes. The distinguish-
ing characteristic of butterﬂy nodes from other handbill roles is that there are some
high-degree nodes existing in their neighbors. They can indirectly inﬂuence more nodes
by their high-degree neighbors. Then, Formula (3) can also evaluate a node’s inﬂuence
for Handbill strategy. Moreover, since Handbill strategy is sensitive to cost, we divide
the inﬂuence of a node by its cost and evaluate a node’s cost-effective value as:
p3)/c(u),

(1 + outD(v) · p) · p −

ce(u) = (1 +

(cid:3)

(5)

(cid:3)

v∈N (u)

∃vi,vj∈N (u),evi ,vj

∈E

where ce(u) is the cost-effective value of node u, c(u) is the cost of node u, N (u) is
the out-neighbors of node u and outD(v) is the out-degree of node v.

72

S. Han et al.

From the above, the algorithm of Handbill strategy can be stated as follows. We only
take handbills that are the nodes with the bottom 80% largest degree in the network as
the candidates for seed selection, and calculate their cost-effective value by Formula (5).
We in turn select the next best candidate with the largest cost-effective value as the seed
until the budget is exhaust. Based on the distance heuristic, when choosing a seed, we
would judge whether its neighbors have already existed in the seed set. If not yet, we
will choose it, otherwise, we will ignore it and take the next one.

3.4 Combination Strategy

After performing the above two strategies, we could get two nonoverlapping seed sets.
One is billboard set, where the seeds have great inﬂuence. The other one is handbill set,
where the seeds are cost-effective. Then, we proposed Combination strategy to select
the “best” seeds from the two “better” seed sets and obtain a compositive solution.
The proposed approach is based on Simulated Annealing algorithm [9], which taking
inﬂuence maximization as the objective, searches an approximate solution in the two
set of nodes.

We ﬁrst give a brief introduction of the procedure of SA algorithm as follows.
(1) The algorithm ﬁrstly initializes an initial state S0, an initial temperature T0, an

annealing schedule T (t) and an objective function E(St).

(2) At each step t, it produces a new state S

(cid:4)
t from the neighbors of the current state
(cid:4)
t or staying in state
St. It probabilistically decides between moving the system to state S
(cid:4)
St. If E(S
t with the probability 1;
otherwise, the system does this move with a probability of exp(−(E(S
t)−E(St))/Tt).
(cid:4)
(3) The algorithm iteratively does step (2), until the system reaches a good enough

t) ≥ E(St), the system moves to the new state S
(cid:4)

state, or until the temperature T decreases to 0.

The Combination strategy is outlined in Algorithm 1. In this strategy, we evaluate
the inﬂuence of a node by Formula(3) and deﬁne the objective function E(S) as the
sum of the inﬂuence of each node in the seed set. We set the initial seed set as billboard
seed set. The algorithm has two levels of node replacements. The ﬁrst one is billboard
replacement(lines 3-10). In this level, we reduce a billboard b ∈ S and add the equal cost
of handbills hi /∈ S to produce a neighbor set. Then, we judge whether to accept the new
set(lines 4-10). If accepted, the algorithm comes into the second level of replacement:
handbill replacement(lines 12-20). In the second level, we randomly replace a handbill
h ∈ S with the equal cost of other handbills hi /∈ S to produce a neighbor set, and judge
whether to accept the new set(lines 14-20). We repeat this replacement for q times. The
billboard replacement is the outer iteration. We in turn try to replace each billboard.
When all the billboard replacements have been executed, the algorithm is ﬁnished.

4.2 Experiment Setup

In the experiment, we adopt simulation method [5] to compute the inﬂuence propaga-
tion of the resulting seed set. Given a seed set, we repeat the simulations for R=10, 000
times and take the average. We use IC model to simulate the inﬂuence propagation and
set the propagation probability to be 0.1. In Combination strategy, we set T0=1, 000, 000
and ΔT =1, 000. All the experiments are performed on a server with Intel(R) Core i7-
4770K CPU, 32G memory. All the codes are written in Java.

We evaluate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the three proposed strategies with
three state-of-the-art algorithms. The ﬁrst baseline algorithm is CELF Greedy
algorithm(CELF G) [7], which is the basic greedy algorithm with CELF speed op-
timization. The second one is Modiﬁed Greedy algorithm(Modiﬁed G) [7], which has

74

been introduced in Section 3.1. The third one is DegreeDiscountIC algorithm(DDIC) [3].
It is a fast algorithm for inﬂuence maximization problem, and we modify it to make it
suit for BIM problem.

4.3 Experiment Results

Accuracy When Varying Budget. In this experiment, we evaluate the accuracy of each
algorithm by varying the budget. In the real world, the advertising price of a web site is
always relevant to its popularity. Then we deﬁne the cost of a node u as outD(u)· p + 1,
where outD(u) is the out-degree of node u and p is the propagation probability.

Fig. 4. Inﬂuence Propagation of Different Algorithms as Budget is Varied

The experiment results are shown in Fig. 4. For HEP-PH network, Combination strat-
egy has the best accuracy. It outperforms the second best algorithm Handbill strategy
by 1.19% averagely, but this advantage reduces with the increase of budget. Combina-
tion strategy and Handbill strategy are superior to Billboard strategy obviously, which
implies it is better to choose cost-effective nodes rather than inﬂuential nodes as seeds
for HEP-PH network. Modiﬁed G and DDIC have similar accuracies. They are respec-
tively inferior to Combination strategy by 10.36% and 13.3% averagely. And CELF G
has the worst performance in accuracy.

For Email network, when the budget B ∈ [0, 5, 000], Billboard strategy is better
than Handbill strategy in accuracy. But when B ∈ (5, 000, 12, 000], the latter over-
takes the former. When B ∈ [0, 2, 000], Modiﬁed G and CELF G have the best ac-
curacies and outperform Combination strategy by 2.7%. When B ∈ (2, 000, 4, 000],
DDIC has the best accuracy and outperforms Combination strategy by 1.45%. When
B ∈ (4, 000, 12, 000], Combination strategy becomes the best algorithm in accuracy.
For P2P network, when the budget B ∈ [0, 8, 000], Billboard strategy has a bet-
ter performance than Handbill strategy in accuracy. But when B ∈ (8, 000, 20, 000],
the latter overtakes the former. When B ∈ [0, 4, 000], Modiﬁed G and CELF G have
the best accuracies and outperform Combination strategy by 2.6% averagely. When
B ∈ (4, 000, 10, 000], DDIC overtakes Greedy algorithm to be the best algorithm and
slightly outperforms Combination strategy by 1.15%. When B ∈ (10, 000, 20, 000],
Combination strategy becomes the best algorithm in accuracy. It outperforms DDIC by
3.03% and outperforms Modiﬁed G by 3.71% averagely.
For Web network, when the budget B ∈ [0, 5, 000], Billboard strategy is better than
Handbill strategy in accuracy. But when B ∈ (5, 000, 20, 000], the latter overtakes the
former. When B ∈ [0, 4, 000], Combination strategy has the best accuracy and outper-
forms the second best algorithm Modiﬁed G by 2.18%. When B ∈ (4, 000, 9, 000],
DDIC overtakes Combination strategy and becomes the best algorithm in accuracy.
It slightly outperforms Combination strategy by 1.72%. When B ∈ (9, 000, 20, 000],
Combination strategy once again becomes the best algorithm. It outperforms Modiﬁed
G by 10.85% and outperforms DDIC by 10.89% averagely.

Accuracy with Different Cost Deﬁnitions. This experiment is to evaluate the accuracy
of each algorithm with different cost deﬁnitions. We respectively deﬁne the cost of a
node u as outD(u) + 1 and outD(u) · c + 1, where outD(u) is the out-degree of node
u, p is the propagation probability and c is a random number in (0, 1]. Due to the space
limitation, we only show the results of HEP-PH network in Fig.5.

Fig. 5. Inﬂuence Propagation of Different Algorithms as Cost is Varied

With these two cost deﬁnitions, when the budget is small, Billboard strategy always
has a better accuracy than Handbill strategy. But with the increase of budget, Handbill
strategy overtakes the former and even outperforms most other algorithms. Combina-
tion strategy has an excellent and stable performance in accuracy. When the budget is

76

small, it may fall behind with the best algorithm slightly. However, as the budget in-
creases, it narrows the gap rapidly and becomes the best algorithm, which outperforms
Handbill strategy slightly and outperforms other algorithms obviously. Modiﬁed G has
a good accuracy when the budget is small. But it is inferior to Combination strategy and
Handbill strategy when the budget is large. We can ﬁnd that the curve of Modiﬁed G
have some drops, which implies the Greedy algorithm falls into local optimums. CELF
G performs well when the budget is small, but it can not maintain the advantage when
the budget is increasing. Comparing with other algorithms, DDIC has a low accuracy.

Efﬁciency We compare the runtimes of the six algorithms, when the budget is 5,000
and the propagation probability is 0.1 on the four networks.

From Table 6, we observe that Billboard strategy, Handbill strategy, Combination
algorithm and DDIC have the runtime in the same order of magnitude. And Combina-
tion algorithm is slightly slower than the other three. By contrast, CELF G has a much
longer runtime and it is slower than the fastest algorithm by three orders of magnitude.
Modiﬁed G has the longest runtime, it is even slower than CELF G by 2 times at least.

5 Conclusions

Unlike most of the existing works on k-node inﬂuence maximization, this paper focuses
on budgeted inﬂuence maximization. We address the BIM problem by three strategies:
Billboard strategy, Handbill strategy and Combination strategy. From the comparison
experiments with the state-of-the-art algorithms, we can conclude that Combination
strategy is the most balanced algorithm. On one hand, it has the best performance or
matches the best algorithms in accuracy. On the other hand, it has the runtime in the
same order of magnitude with the fastest algorithm. Billboard strategy and Handbill
strategy have the best efﬁciencies. They can obtain good solutions in some situations.
