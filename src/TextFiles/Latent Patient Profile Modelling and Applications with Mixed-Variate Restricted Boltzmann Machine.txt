Abstract. Eﬃcient management of chronic diseases is critical in mod-
ern health care. We consider diabetes mellitus, and our ongoing goal is
to examine how machine learning can deliver information for clinical
eﬃciency. The challenge is to aggregate highly heterogeneous sources
including demographics, diagnoses, pathologies and treatments, and ex-
tract similar groups so that care plans can be designed. To this end, we
extend our recent model, the mixed-variate restricted Boltzmann ma-
chine (MV.RBM), as it seamlessly integrates multiple data types for each
patient aggregated over time and outputs a homogeneous representation
called “latent proﬁle” that can be used for patient clustering, visualisa-
tion, disease correlation analysis and prediction. We demonstrate that
the method outperforms all baselines on these tasks - the primary char-
acteristics of patients in the same groups are able to be identiﬁed and
the good result can be achieved for the diagnosis codes prediction.

Introduction

Chronic diseases are rampant. Health care costs are increasingly related to such
diseases. Diabetes mellitus is one such chronic disease from which 346 million
people worldwide suﬀer, as estimated by The World Health Organization (WHO)
[1]. Only about 5 − 10% of them have Type I diabetes mellitus, whilst Type
II comprises the rest. The people who suﬀer Type I are not able to produce
insulin. In contrast, Type II diabetes means that there is an inability to absorb
insulin. In 2004, 3.4 million people died from complications of high blood sugar.
The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing, and being diagnosed in younger
people. This leads to serious complications - deterioration in blood vessels, eyes,
kidneys and nerves. It is a chronic, lifelong disease.

Escalating health costs are associated with such chronic diseases. To provide
high quality healthcare, care plans are issued to patients to manage them within
the community, taking steps in advance so that these people are not hospitalised.
Thus, it is imperative to identify groups of patients with similar characteristics
so that they can be covered by a coherent care plan. Additionally, if the hospital
can predict the disease codes arising from escalating complication of chronic
disease, it can adjust ﬁnancial and manpower resources. Thus useful prediction
of codes for chronic disease can lead to service eﬃciency.

Clustering is a natural selection for this task. However, medical data is com-
plex – it is mixed-type containing Boolean data (e.g., male/female), continuous
quantities (e.g., age), single categories (e.g., regions), and repeated categories
(e.g., disease codes). Traditional clustering methods cannot naturally integrate
such data and we choose to extend the our recent model, the mixed-variate re-
stricted Boltzmann machine (MV.RBM) [2]. The mixed-variate RBM uncovers
latent proﬁle factors, enabling subsequent clustering. Using a cohort of 6, 931
chronic diabetes patients with data from 2007 to 2011, we collect 3, 178 diagno-
sis codes (treated as repeated categories) and combine it with region-of-birth (as
categories) and age (as Gaussian variables) to form our dataset. We show clus-
tering results obtained from running aﬃnity propagation (AP) [3], containing 10
clusters and qualitatively evaluate the disease codes of groups. We demonstrate
that the mixed-variate RBM followed by AP outperforms all baseline methods –
Bayesian mixture model and aﬃnity propagation on the original diagnosis codes,
and k-means and AP on latent proﬁles, discovered by just the plain RBM [4].

Predicting disease codes for future years enables hospitals to prepare ﬁnance,
equipment and logistics for individual requirements of patients. Thus prediction
of disease codes forms the next part of our study. Using the mixed-variate RBM
and the dataset described above, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
other methods, establishing the versatility of the latent proﬁle discovery with
mixed-variate RBM.

In short, our main contributions are: (i) Novel extension and application of a
powerful data mining tool, mixed-variate RBM, to a complex hospital chronic
disease dataset, for clustering and understanding of disease codes within sub-
groups; (ii) Disease code prediction, using the model; and (iii) Demonstration of
the method and showing that it outperforms baseline models, in both clustering
and prediction on this complex data.

The signiﬁcance of our work is to build a framework that is able to support
healthcare centres and clinicians delivering outcomes that can integrate with
their operations to enhance clinical eﬃciencies. Using such systems, the man-
agement and supervision on diabetes patients in particular as well as other kinds
of diseases patients in general would have the potential to improve.

The rest of paper is organized as follows. The next section presents our pa-
tient proﬁle modelling framework. Next, we describe our implementation on the
diabetes cohort and demonstrate eﬃciencies of our methods. Section 4 discusses
related work and modelling choices as well as the other potentials of the proposed
framework, followed by conclusions in Section 5.

2 Latent Patient Proﬁling

A patient proﬁle in modern hospitals typically consists of multiple records includ-
ing demographics, admissions, diagnoses, surgeries, pathologies and medication.
Each record contains several ﬁelds, each of which is type-speciﬁc. For example,
age can be considered as a continuous quantity but a diagnosis code is a dis-
crete element. At the ﬁrst approximation, each patient can be represented by

using a long vector of mixed types1. However, joint modelling of mixed types is
known to be highly challenging even for a small set of variables [5,6]. Complete
patient proﬁling, on the other hand, requires handling of thousands of variables.
Of equal importance is that the proﬁling should readily support a variety of
clinical analysis tasks such as patient clustering, visualisation and disease pre-
diction. In what follows, we develop a representational and computational scheme
to capture such heterogeneity in an eﬃcient way. In particular, we extend the
our recently introduced machinery known as mixed-variate restricted Boltzmann
machine (MV.RBM) [2] for the task.

2.1 Mixed-Variate Restricted Boltzmann Machines

A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a bipartite undirected graphical
model with two layers, where the input layer consists of visible units and the
other layer the binary hidden units [7]. See, for example, Fig. 1 for an illustration.
A mixed-variate RBM is a RBM with inhomogeneous input units, each of which
has the own type. More formally, let v denote the joint set of visible variables:
v = (v1, v2, ..., vN ), h the joint set of binary hidden units: h = (h1, h2, ..., hK),
where hk ∈ {0, 1} for all k. Each visible unit encodes type-speciﬁc information,
and the hidden units capture the latent factors not presented in the observations.
Thus the MV.RBM can be seen as a way to transform inhomogeneous observa-
tional record into a homogeneous representation of the patient proﬁle. Another
way to view this as a mixture model where there are 2K mixture components.
This capacity is arguably important to capture all factors of variation in the
patient cohort.
The MV.RBM deﬁnes a Boltzmann distribution over all variables: P (v, h; ψ) =
e−E(v,h)/Z (ψ), where E (v, h) is model energy, Z (ψ) is the normalising constant
and ψ is model parameter. In particular, the energy is deﬁned as

where a = (a1, a2, .., aN ) , b = (b1, b2, ..., bK) are biases of visible and hidden
units, and W = [Wik] represents the weights connecting hidden and visible
units, and Fi(vi) are type-speciﬁc function. The bipartite structure allows con-
ditional independence among intra-layer variables which lead to the following
factorisations:

P (v | h) =

P (vi | h)

(2)

P (h | v) =

The conditional separation of types in Eq. (2) is critical: This allows inde-
pendent speciﬁcation of type-speciﬁc data generative models and at the same

gation scheme to summarize the ﬁeld. Here we use the simple counting for diagnosis
codes.

time achieves higher-order dependencies through the “pooling” layer h. For

example, let fi(h) = ai +

P (vi | h) = 1/
(i.e., Fi(vi) = 0); the Gaussian units: P (vi | h) =

(i.e., Fi(vi) = −v2

for some learning rate ν > 0. Here Ev,h denotes the expectation with respect to
the full model distribution P (v, h; ψ), Eh|v the conditional distribution given
the known v. Whilst the conditional expectation can be compute eﬃciently, the
full expectation is generally intractable. Thus we must resort to approximate
methods, and in this paper, we choose a truncated MCMC-based method known
as contrastive divergence (CD) [8] as it proves to be fast and accurate. A MCMC
chain is obtained by alternating between ˆv ∼ P

and ˆh ∼ P (h | ˆv).

2.2 MV.RBM for Patient Proﬁling

The goal of patient proﬁling is to construct an eﬀective personal representation
from multiple hospital records. Here we focus mainly on patient demographics
(e.g., age, gender and region-of-birth) and their existing health conditions (e.g.,
existing diagnoses). For simplicity, we consider a binary gender (male/female).
Further, age can be considered as a continuous quantity and thus a Gaussian unit
can be used2; and region-of-birth and diagnosis as categorical variables. However,
since the same diagnosis can be repeated during the course of readmissions, it is
better to include them all. In particular, we adopt the idea from the “replicated
softmax” [4] where repeated diagnoses share the same parameters. In the end,
we build one MV.RBM per patient due to the diﬀerence in the diagnosis sets.
Further, to balance the contribution of the hidden units against the variation in
input length, it is important to make a change to the energy model in Eq. (1) as
follows: Db ← b where D is the total number of input variables for each patient.
We note that these parameter sharing and balancing are not readily present in
the current MV.RBM of Truyen et al [2].

our model is a mixture of exponentially many components (2K , see Sec. 2.1 for
detail), and thus can capture any distribution with high accuracy.

As we will then demonstrate in Section 3, the latent proﬁle can be used as input
for a variety of analysis tasks such as patient clustering and visualisation.

Interestingly, the model also enables a certain degree of disease prediction, i.e.,
we want to guess which diagnoses will be positive for the patient in the future3.
Although this may appear to be an impossible task, it is plausible statistically
because some diseases are highly correlated or even causative, and there are
certain pathways that a disease may progress. More speciﬁcally, subset of diag-
noses at time t + 1 can be predicted by searching for the mode of the following
conditional distribution:

Unfortunately the search is intractable as we need to traverse through the space
of all possible disease combinations, which has the size of 2M where M is the set
of diagnosis codes. To simplify the task and to reuse of the readily discovered
latent proﬁle ˆh(1:t), we assume that (i) the model distribution is not changed due
to the “unseen” future, (ii) the latent proﬁle at this point captures everything we
can say about the state of the patient, and (iii) future diseases are conditionally

complicated since diseases may be recurrent, and the strict temporal orders must be
observed to make the model clinically plausible.

Implementation and Results

In this section we present the analysis of patient proﬁles using the data obtained
from Barwon Health, Victoria, Australia5, during the period of 2007 − 2011
using the extended MV.RBM described in Section 2. In particular, we evaluate
the capacity of the MV.RBM for patient clustering and for predicting future
diseases. For the former task, the MV.RBM is can be seen as a way to transform
complex input data into a homogeneous vector from which post-processing steps
(e.g., clustering and visualisation) can take place. For the prediction task, the
MV.RBM acts as a classiﬁer that map inputs into outputs.

Our main interest is in the diabetes cohort of 7, 746 patients. There are two types
of diabetes: Type I is typically present in younger patients who are not able to
produce insulin; and Type II is more popular in the older group who, on the other
hand, cannot adsorb insulin. One of the most important indicators of diabetes is
the high blood sugar level compared to the general population. Diabetes are typ-
ically associated with multiple diseases and complications: The cohort contains
5, 083 distinct diagnosis codes, many of which are related to other conditions and
diseases such as obesity, tobacco use and heart problems. For robustness, we re-
move those rare diagnosis codes with less than 4 occurrences in the data. This
results in a dataset of 6, 931 patients who originally came from 102 regions and
were diagnosed with totally 3, 178 unique codes. The inclusion of age and gender
into the model is obvious: they are not only related to and contributing to the dia-
betes types, they are also largely associated with other complications. Information
about the regions-of-origin is also important for diabetes because it is strongly re-
lated to the social conditions and lifestyles, which are of critical importance to the
proactive control of the blood sugar level, which is by far the most cost-eﬀective
method to mitigate diabetes-related consequences.

3.1 Implementation

Continuous variables are ﬁrst normalised across the cohort so that the Gaussian
inputs have zero-means and unit variances. We employ 1-step contrastive diver-
gence (CD) [8] for learning. Learning rates vary from type to type and they are
chosen so that reconstruction errors at each data sweep are gradually reduced.

Parameters are updated after each mini-batch of 100 patients, and learning is
terminated after 100 data sweeps. The number of hidden units is determined
empirically to be 200 since large size does not necessarily improve the cluster-
ing/prediction performance.

For patient clustering, once the model has been learned, the hidden posteriors
that are computed using Eq. (3) can be used as the new representation of the
data. To enable fast bitwise implementation (e.g., see [9]), we then convert the
k | v) ≥ ρ1
continuous posteriors into binary activation as follows: ˆhk = 1 if P (h1
and ˆPk = 0 otherwise for all k = 1, 2.., K and some threshold ρ1 ∈ (0, 1). We then
apply well-known clustering methods including aﬃnity propagation (AP) [3], k-
means and Bayesian mixture models (BMM). The AP is of particular interest
for our exploratory analysis because it is capable of automatically determining
the number of clusters. It requires the similarity measure between two patients,
and in our binary proﬁles, a natural measure is the Jaccard coeﬃcient:

| S {p} ∩ S {q} |
| S {p} ∪ S {q} |

J (p, q) =

(6)
where S{p} is the set of activated hidden units for patient p. Another hyper-
parameter is the so-called ‘preference’ which we empirically set to the average
of all pairwise similarities multiplied by −20. This setting gives a reasonable
clustering.

The other two clustering methods require a prior number of clusters, and
here we use the output from the AP. For the k-means, we use the the Hamming
distance between activation vectors of the two patients6. The BMM is a Bayesian
model with multinomial emission probability.

The task of disease prediction is translated into predicting diagnoses in the
future for each patient. We split data into 2 subsets: The earlier subset, which
contains those diagnoses in the period of 2007 − 2010, is used to train the
MV.RBM; and the later subset is used to evaluate the prediction performance.
In the MV.RBM, we order the future diseases according to the probability that
the disease occurs as in Eq. (5).

3.2 Patient Clustering

First we wish to validate that the latent proﬁles discovered by the MV.RBM are
informative enough so that clinically meaningful clusters can be formed. Fig. 2
shows the 10 clusters returned by the AP and the similarity between every pa-
tient pair (depicted in colour, where the similarity increases with from blue to
red). It is interesting that, out of 10 groups, we are able to discover a group whose
conditions are mostly related to Type I diabetes (Figs. 3a and 3b), and another
group associated with Type II diabetes (Figs. 4a and 4b). The grouping properties
can be examined visually using a visualisation tool known as t-SNE [10] to project
the latent proﬁles onto 2D. Fig. 5a depicts the distribution of patients, where the
colours are based on the group indices assigned earlier by the AP.

6 The centroid of each cluster is chosen according to the median elementwise.

For quantitative evaluation, we calculate the Rand-index [11] to assess the
quality of resulting clusters, given that we do not have cluster labels. The Rand-
index is the pairwise accuracy between any two patients. To judge whether two
patients share the same cluster, we consult the diagnosis code hierarchy of the
ICD-10 [12]. We use hierarchical assessment since a diagnosis code may have
multiple levels. E11.12, for example, has two levels: E11 and E11.12. The lower
level code speciﬁes disease more clearly whilst the higher is more abstract. There-
fore we have two ways for pairwise judgement: the Jaccard coeﬃcient (Section
3.1) and code ‘cluster’ which is the grouping of codes that belong to the same
disease class, as speciﬁed by the latest WHO standard ICD-10. At the lowest
level, two patients are considered similar if the two corresponding code sets are
suﬃciently overlapping, i.e., their Jaccard coeﬃcient is greater than a thresh-

old ρ2 ∈ (0, 1). At higher level, on the other hand, we consider two patients to

be clinically similar if they share higher level diabetes code of the same code
‘cluster’. For instance, two patients with two codes E11.12 and E11.20 are sim-
ilar at the level E117, but they are dissimilar at the lower level. Note that this
hierarchical division is for evaluation only. We use codes at the lowest level as
replicated softmax units in our model (Section 2.2).

Fig. 5b reports the Rank-indices with respect to the assessment at the lowest
level in the ICD-10 hierarchy for clustering methods with and without MV.RBM
pre-processing. At the next ICD-10 level, the MV.RBM/AP achieves a Rand-
index of 0.6040, which is, again, the highest among all methods, e.g., using the
RBM/AP yields the score of 0.5870, and using AP on diagnosis codes yields
0.5529. This clearly demonstrates that (i) MV.RBM latent proﬁles would lead
to better clustering that those using diagnosis codes directly, and (ii) modelling
mixed-types would be better than using just one input type (e.g., the diagnosis
codes).

3.3 Disease Prediction

The prediction results are summarised in Fig. 6, where the ROC curve of the
MV.RBM is compared against that of the baseline using k-nearest neighbours
(k-NN). The k-NN approach to disease ranking is as follows: For each patient, a
neighbourhood of the 50 most similar patients is collected based on the Jaccard
coeﬃcient over sets of unique diagnoses. The diagnoses are then ranked accord-
ing to their occurrence frequency within the neighbourhood. As can be seen
from the ﬁgure, the latent proﬁle approaches outperform the k-NN method. The
MV.RBM with contextual information such as age, gender and region-of-birth
proves to be useful. In particular the the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of
the MV.RBMs are 0.84 (with contextual information) and 0.82 (without con-
textual information). These are clearly better than the score obtained by k-NN,
which is 0.77.

4 Discussion and Related Work

This work is part of our ongoing eﬀort to apply data mining and statistical
techniques to understand the complex health databases in order to improve the
services eﬃciency within health organisations and across coordinated networks.
This line of research has recently attracted considerable interest in the data
mining community (e.g., see [13,14]). Our focus on diabetes is motivated by the
pressing demands to deliver personalised cares for the large population on an
ongoing basis [15,16]. However, we wish to emphasize that the approach is quite
general and could be applicable to other cohorts.

Latent Patient Proﬁle Modelling and Applications

133

In terms of modelling, our work adds a few more ﬂavours to the current
mixed-variate analysis in biomedical domains [5,6,17]. The existing literature of-
fers three approaches: The ﬁrst is to specify the direct type-speciﬁc conditional
relationship between two variables (e.g., see [5]), the second is to assume that
each observable is generated from a latent variable (latent variables then encode
the dependencies) (e.g., see [6]), and the third is to construct joint cumulative
distributions using copula [18,17]. The drawback of the ﬁrst approach is that it
requires far more domain knowledge and statistical expertise to design a cor-
rect model even for a small number of variables. The second approach lifts the
direct dependencies to the latent variables level. All approaches are, however,
not very scalable to realistic setting of the hospital records. Our treatment using
MV.RBM [2], along with the line of work using RBMs for representing com-
plex data [19,20,21], oﬀers the fourth alternative: Direct pairwise dependencies
are substituted by indirect long-range dependencies. Not only this simpliﬁes the
model design, the inference is much more scalable: each MCMC sweep through
all variables takes only linear time. Our most recent work in [21], while enjoying
the similar computational eﬃciency, oﬀers a better interpretation through the
use of latent variables to capture the generative mechanism of data types.

Latent proﬁling could be important for other applications such as patient
retrieval, i.e., we want to retrieve patients with clinically similar conditions to
the patient under study. In this setting, using raw diagnosis codes may miss
those whose codes are diﬀerent from the present patient even if they share the
same clinical conditions. The use of MV.RBM, on the other hand, would project
these patients onto similar latent proﬁles. It is also of interest to ask whether it
is justiﬁable for the choice of parameter sharing for repeated diagnoses. To get
answer, we experimented with the “counting” treatments in which each code is
considered as a Poisson variable, and our clustering/prediction results indicate
that it is much better to employ the parameter sharing trick. This may due to
the fact that under the Poisson treatment, diagnoses are assumed to “arrive”
independently, while in reality diagnoses are generally correlated.

5 Conclusion

We have presented a latent proﬁling framework using our recently introduced ar-
chitecture known as mixed-variate restricted Boltzmann machines (MV.RBM).
The goal was to develop a representational and computational scheme that can
handle complex, inhomogeneous data from real hospital settings. The MV.RBM
was adapted to handle recurrent diagnoses by parameter sharing and variable
balancing. We evaluated this scheme on a cohort of complex diseases such as
diabetes, where there are many inﬂuential factors, and diagnoses are often re-
peated, correlated and causative. It is demonstrated that the chosen scheme is
highly eﬀective for exploratory tasks such as patient clustering and visualisation
and predictive tasks such as 1-year diagnosis prognosis.
