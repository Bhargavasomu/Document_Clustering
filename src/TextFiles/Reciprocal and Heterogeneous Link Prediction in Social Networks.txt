Abstract. Link prediction is a key technique in many applications in
social networks, where potential links between entities need to be pre-
dicted. Conventional link prediction techniques deal with either homoge-
neous entities, e.g., people to people, item to item links, or non-reciprocal
relationships, e.g., people to item links. However, a challenging problem
in link prediction is that of heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction,
such as accurate prediction of matches on an online dating site, jobs or
workers on employment websites, where the links are reciprocally deter-
mined by both entities that heterogeneously belong to disjoint groups.
The nature and causes of interactions in these domains makes hetero-
geneous and reciprocal link prediction signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
conventional version of the problem. In this work, we address these is-
sues by proposing a novel learnable framework called ReHeLP, which
learns heterogeneous and reciprocal knowledge from collaborative infor-
mation and demonstrate its impact on link prediction. Evaluation on a
large commercial online dating dataset shows the success of the proposed
method and its promise for link prediction.

Introduction

Social networks are commonly used to model the interactions among people in
communities, which can be represented by graphs where a vertex corresponds
to a person in some community and an edge or link represents some association
between the corresponding people. Understanding the association between two
speciﬁc vertices by predicting the likelihood of a future but not currently existing
association between them is a fundamental problem known as link prediction [13].
Social interaction on the Web often involves both positive and negative rela-
tionships, e.g., since attempts to establish a relationship may fail due to rejection
from the intended target. This generates links that signify rejection of invita-
tions, disapproval of applications, or expression of disagreement with others’
opinions. Such social networks are reciprocal since the sign of a link indicating

Links as interactions connect nodes (in circles) that belong to diﬀerent groups (grey
shading or no shading). The signs of links represent matches of two way decisions,
which are predicted by a learning model using collaborative information.

whether it is positive or negative depends on the attitudes or opinions of both
entities forming the link. While the interplay of positive and negative relations
is clearly important in many social network settings, the vast majority of on-
line social network research has considered only positive relationships. Moreover,
reciprocal positive and negative relationships have been even less investigated.
Recently, social network analysis has had a variety of applications, such as online
dating sites, education admission portals as well as jobs, employment, career and
recruitment sites, where people in the networks have diﬀerent roles, and links
between them can only be between people in diﬀerent roles. Such networks are
heterogeneous, creating challenges for link prediction since existing approaches
focus only on homogeneous networks where nodes in the networks have the same
role and any of them may link to any other.

In this work, we consider the heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction
problem. We propose a framework to address prediction of the sign of a link
in heterogeneous and reciprocal networks. We model this problem as a machine
learning problem and create structural features for learning, i.e. we construct
features for learning based on structural collaborative information. Speciﬁcally,
motivated by taste and attractiveness in the Social Collaborative Filter [4], we
ﬁrst deﬁne a structural unit called a tetrad (to be deﬁned in Section 4.1), i.e.
a path crossing four nodes as in Figure 1 [4], in the graph of networks based
on a set of variations of collaborative ﬁltering. These represent collaborative
information regarding taste and attractiveness of nodes in the graph (people in
social networks). The properties of each tetrad are then measured in terms of
positive and negative signs through its path. Finally, the properties of a tetrad
are used as features in a learning framework for link sign prediction.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents related work. Section 3
deﬁnes the problem. Section 4 develops a learnable framework for the recipro-

cal and heterogeneous link prediction problem. Experimental evaluation is in
Section 5 and we conclude in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg [13] developed one of the earliest link prediction
models for social networks. They concentrated mostly on the performance of
various graph-based similarity metrics for the link prediction problem. This work
has since been extended to use supervised learning for link prediction [8, 2, 7],
where link prediction was considered as a binary classiﬁcation task in a super-
vised learning setup using features extracted from various network properties.

Recent developments in online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter
have raised scalability challenges for link prediction. Large scale link prediction
was addressed by Acar et al. in [1], where higher-order tensor models based on
matrix factorisation were used for link prediction in large social networks.

Recently, work on link prediction has started considering both negative and
positive relationships in online websites [12, 3, 10, 11]. Leskovec et al. investigated
the problem of link sign prediction to uncover the mechanisms that determine
the signs of links in large social networks where interactions can be both positive
and negative [12]. Also, learning methods based on multiple sources and multiple
path-based features were investigated. In [6], there is a collective link prediction
problem where several related link prediction tasks are jointly learned. In [14], a
supervised learning framework has been designed based on a rich variety of path-
based features using multiple sources to learn the dynamics of social networks.
In reciprocal and heterogeneous link prediction, the reciprocal and heteroge-
neous nature of networks makes the problem signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from tradi-
tional link prediction. Therefore, new methods to: 1) model the characteristics of
how reciprocal and heterogeneous links form; and 2) that can be used for mining
and predicting such links in large social network datasets are essential.

3 Problem Statement

Link prediction is deﬁned as the inference of new interactions among the mem-
bers of a given social network [13]. More formally, the link prediction problem
is deﬁned as: given a snapshot of a social network at time t, seek to accurately
predict the edges that will be added to the network during the interval from
time t to a given future time t′ = t + δt. The solution to this problem lies in
modelling the evolution of the network using intrinsic features derived from the
network itself in order to understand which properties of the network lead to the
most accurate link predictions.

Edge sign prediction is an important type of link prediction, deﬁned as fol-
lows. Suppose we are given a social network with signs on all its edges, but the
sign on the edge from node u to node v, denoted s(u, v), has been hidden. How
reliably can we infer this sign s(u, v) using the information provided by the rest

4

of the network? This problem is both a concrete formulation of our basic ques-
tions about the typical patterns of link signs, and also a way of approaching our
motivating application of inferring unobserved attitudes among users of social
computing sites. For a given link in a social network, we will deﬁne its sign to
be positive or negative depending on whether it expresses a positive or negative
attitude from the source of the directed link to the target, and vice versa.

Heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction deals with predictions for het-
erogeneous and reciprocal links in social networks. We deﬁne the key concepts
as follows. A heterogeneous and reciprocal link is a link (u, v) that has its two
nodes u and v belonging to diﬀerent types, or groups (i.e., the nodes are het-
erogeneous) and its edge sign depends on the attitudes of both nodes (i.e., link
establishment is reciprocal). Heterogeneous and reciprocal social networks are
networks connected only by heterogeneous and reciprocal links. A heterogeneous
and reciprocal link prediction problem (ReHeLP ) is the prediction of links in
heterogeneous and reciprocal social networks.

Heterogeneous and reciprocal social networks exist in many applications (e.g.,
online dating sites, education admission sites, as well as jobs, employment, career
and recruitment sites). In online dating sites, we have: 1) users belonging to
diﬀerent groups (male or female); 2) links established only between users from
diﬀerent groups; and 3) link signs dependent on the compatibility of user pairs.

4 Methods

Given a directed graph G = (V, E) with a sign (positive or negative) on each
edge, we let s(u, v) denote the sign of the edge (u, v) from node u to node v.
That is, s(u, v) = 1 when the sign of (u, v)) is positive, 0 when negative. For
diﬀerent formulations of our task, we suppose that for a particular edge (u, v),
the sign s(u, v) is hidden and that we trying to infer it.

4.1 Feature Construction

The ﬁrst step towards our heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction is feature
construction, which deﬁnes a collection of features for learning a model. The
features are divided into two categories, according to their relationships to the
entities in the networks.

Monadic Features In social networks, the activity and popularity of an entity
have impact on the behaviour of the entity. Therefore, the ﬁrst category of
characteristics of entities to be measured for link prediction is the activity and
popularity of entities, which are the aggregated local relations of an entity to the
rest of the world. This type of information represents the baseline, quantifying
how many ingoing and outgoing edges a node could have.

The number of outgoing actions of a node measures how active an entity in
the networks is, represented by its out-degree, the number of outgoing edges of
a node in graph. We deﬁne the ﬁrst monadic features based on the degree of

Reciprocal and Heterogeneous Link Prediction

the outgoing edges, as follows. An outgoing edge e of a node v is an edge that
directs from v to another node. The degree of outgoing edges of a node do(v) is
the number of outgoing edges from that node v. We also separate the outgoing
edges according to their sign and deﬁne the degree of positive outgoing edges
and the degree of negative outgoing edges, which represents not only the activity
but also the general attitude of an entity to the world. The degree of positive
outgoing edges of a node d+
o (v) is the number of outgoing edges from that node
v and with positive sign. The degree of negative outgoing edges of a node d−
o (v),
is the number of outgoing edges from that node v and with negative sign.

Similarly, the number of incoming actions of a node measures how popular
an entity is in the network, represented by the degree of incoming edges. There-
fore, we deﬁne the degree of positive incoming edges and the degree of negative
incoming edges to model the popularity and again general attitude of an entity
as follows. The degree of positive incoming edges of a node d+
i (v) is the number
of incoming edges to that node v with positive sign. The degree of negative in-
coming edges of a node d−
i (v), is the number of incoming edges to that node v
with negative sign.

The four monadic features (d+

i (v)) will be used in our
method to represent the activity and popularity as well as the general attitude
of an entity in a network.

o (v), d−

o (v), d+

i (v), d+

Dyadic Features We also deﬁne dyadic features based on collaborative infor-
mation. Collaborative information is the information extracted from a commu-
nity that represents knowledge about the network derived from collaborative
eﬀorts. Collaborative information is the basis of collaborative ﬁltering for rec-
ommendation, which makes automatic predictions about the interests of a user
by collecting preferences or taste information from many other users. We make
use of collaborative information for link prediction and extract dyadic features
as in collaborative ﬁltering.

The links of interest represent reciprocal relationships between entities, re-
quiring reciprocal collaborative information to be considered [4, 5, 9]. Reciprocal
collaborative information could be embedded in several diﬀerent kinds of collab-
orative ﬁltering frameworks. In [4], a general framework for reciprocal collabo-
rative ﬁltering was developed for recommendation, which was then extended in
several variant methods [9]. Here, we contribute to integrating such collaborative
information into a learnable framework for link prediction, rather than recom-
mendation. Moreover, we aim at prediction of heterogeneous links, hence both
nodes of a link cannot link to the same third node. For example, in people to
people dating recommendation, a link only exists between a heterogeneous pair,
i.e. a male type and a female type (we do not consider same-sex relationships in
this work). In this bipartite representation the sender and recipient cannot both
link to the same third person. Therefore, we consider a three step path involving
both nodes within a potential link, which is deﬁned as a tetrad in Deﬁnition 1.

Deﬁnition 1. A tetrad t(u, sv, su, v) or t(u, v) is a three step path among four
diﬀerent nodes (u → sv → su → v) in a graph, where the source node u (sender)

and a node similar to it su (deﬁned by collaborative ﬁltering) both belong to one
of the two types, while the target node v (recipient) and another node similar to
it sv both belong to the other type.

A tetrad t(u, v) captures a two step relationship across two types, which
is the minimum indirect path between a pair of nodes (u, v). Tetrad is a novel
type of sub-graph feature for heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction, which
captures collaborative information that cannot be captured by features used in
existing link prediction approaches. The following feature sets for each pair of
nodes (u, v) are then based on a variety of minimum indirect paths deﬁned on
the pair.

The ﬁrst type of dyadic features is based on Typical Reciprocal Collaborative
Information. As shown in Figure 2, this is the typical reciprocal collaborative
ﬁltering for people to people recommendation with two-way preferences [4, 5]. In
the ﬁgure, ua is the source node (corresponding to u in Deﬁnition 1), ur the target
node (v in Deﬁnition 1), ustr and usar the similar nodes (sv in Deﬁnition 1), usaa
and usta the similar nodes (su in Deﬁnition 1). From this conﬁguration, we can
construct two set of features. One set is (on the top half of the ﬁgure) to capture
the collaborative information for predicting the recipient’s preference. The other
set is (on the bottom half of the ﬁgure) to capture the collaborative information
for predicting the initiator’s preference. Since we have positive or negative signs
for each interaction and there are 3 interactions in each set as shown in the
ﬁgure, we can create 2 ∗ 23 = 16 features of this type as in Table 1 indicated by
RSR and SRS. In Table 1, a tetrad type is presented by the directions of three
edges from u to v in a tetrad t(u, v), where S and s mean a link from a precursor
to a successor, R and r to a precursor from a successor, and their signs, where +
means a positive link and − negative. n is used to represent the number of links
of a tetrad type. To give an example, n(r+s−r+) means the total number of the
type of tetrad t(u, sv, su, v) that have a positive link from u to sv, a negative
link to sv from su and a positive link from su to v.

The second type of dyadic feature is based on Inverted Reciprocal Collabora-
tive Information. This type of dyadic feature is derived by ﬁtting the inverted

collaborative ﬁlters [9] into the reciprocal collaborative ﬁltering framework [4].
There are two types of inverted collaborative ﬁlters: user-based and item-based.
In this work, we make use of both of these inverted collaborative ﬁlters to gener-
ate more features. We ﬁrst take the recipient-based inverted collaborative ﬁlter-
ing and add another novel type of collaborative information (on the top half of
the ﬁgure) to capture the preference of the recipient as shown in Figure 3. The
original inverted collaborative ﬁlters only model positive signs for all interactions
in the conﬁguration. To allow more collaborative information to be considered
by the learning system in our conﬁguration, we use both positive and negative
signs in any interaction within the conﬁguration, and rely on the machine learn-
ing method to select discriminative features. Similarly, we add one more new
type of collaborative information (on the top half of the ﬁgure) to the sender-
based inverted collaborative ﬁltering to capture the preference of the recipient as
shown in Figure 4. We also allow both positive and negative signs for interaction.
Features based on inverted collaborative information are summarised in Table 1
indicated by RRS, RSS, SRR and SSR.

The third type of dyadic feature is based on Transmissible Collaborative
Information. Dyadic features are considered also to capture the transmissible
properties of preferences as in Figure 5. Similar to [9], if we only consider positive
interactions in creating the collaborative information, we should then have the
property of preference transmission. This can be easily validated by the taste and
attractiveness concept in [4]. Similarly, we have the ﬁrst set of features (on the top
half of the ﬁgure) to capture the recipient’s preference and another set of features
(on the bottom half of the ﬁgure) to capture the sender’s preference. We again
allow both positive and negative signs in any interaction within the conﬁguration.
Features based on preference transmission are illustrated in Table 1 indicated
by SSS and RRR.

Each of these 64 tetrad types may provide diﬀerent evidence about the sign of
the edge from the initiator to the recipient, possibly some favouring a negative
sign and some favouring a positive sign. We encode this information in a 64-
dimensional vector specifying the number of tetrads of each type that both
nodes in a link are involved in. Notice that this is the ﬁrst time a complete set of
combinations showing all possible sources of collaborative information derived
from the structure of tetrads has been used for link prediction.

4.2 Learning and Testing

To predict links, we ﬁrst calculate the feature values and then calculate a measure
of combined feature strength as the weighted combination of feature values, as
follows:

s =

n

X

i=1

ωixi + ω0

(1)

where s is the combined feature strength, xi the value of the i th feature and ωi
the weight value for xi. To learn the weights and convert this combined feature
strength into an edge sign prediction, we use logistic regression, which will output
a value in the range of (0, 1) representing the probability of a positive edge sign:

p =

1

1 + e−s

(2)

where p is the predicted probability of an positive edge sign.

We will show in Section 5 that by using logistic regression, we are also able
to uncover the contribution of each feature to the prediction by investigating the
learned coeﬃcients.

Once we have the learned model, testing is simply to calculate feature values
for each test instance (pair of nodes) and input them into the learned model
to compute the probability of a positive link between them. The instances are
then classiﬁed into positive or negative according to the thresholding of the
probability value with respect to a threshold.

5 Experiments

5.1 Setup

In these experiments, we aim to evaluate the proposed approach on link pre-
diction of dating social networks in a real world dataset, which is a demanding
real-world one. Link prediction on dating social networking is a typical hetero-
geneous and reciprocal link prediction problem, where the nodes are users and
links are interactions. Here users are either of male or female type, links are only
estimated between users of a diﬀerent type and the link sign depends on the
decisions of both users. The datasets were collected from a commercial social

network (online dating) site containing interactions between users. Speciﬁcally,
the data contains records, each of which represents a contact (communication)
by a tuple containing the identity of the contact’s sender, the identity of the con-
tact’s recipient, and an indicator showing whether the interaction was successful
(with a positive response from the recipient to the sender) or unsuccessful (with
a negative response or no response).

The experiments were conducted on a dataset covering a four week period
in March, 2010. The dataset contains all users with at least one contact in the
speciﬁc period. The dataset used for this research is summarised in Table 2. We
follow the methodology of Leskovec [12] and created a balanced dataset with
equal numbers of positive and negative edges.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work on edge sign pre-
diction in heterogeneous and reciprocal networks. Therefore, we took the recent
approach to positive and negative link prediction in online social networks by
Leskovec et al. [12] as the baseline to compare to the proposed algorithm, which
has been reported to signiﬁcantly improve on previous approaches [12]. The
baseline method uses all valid features except those based on two-step paths
that are not valid for heterogeneous and reciprocal link prediction since the lat-
ter has a tetrad structure. Notice that although the baseline method has some
utility in heterogeneous and reciprocal link sign prediction, it is not designed
for that problem. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to consider the
heterogeneous and reciprocal link sign prediction problem.

We use accuracy, precision and recall as evaluation metrics for evaluation of
the proposed algorithm. We also use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for our evaluation.

Algorithms for feature extraction were implemented using SQL in Oracle
11. Learning and testing algorithms were implemented in Matlab. For the large
scale dataset in Table 2, feature extraction required less than 1 hour. Training
on 90% of the balanced dataset and testing on the remaining 10% of the dataset
took about 1 minute on a workstation with 64-bit Windows 7 Professional, 2
processors of Intel(R) Xenon(R) CPU x5660@2.80GHz and 32GB RAM.

5.2 Results

To compare the proposed method to the baseline method, we conducted ex-
periments to generate values for the evaluation metrics from two methods and
statistically tested signiﬁcance of diﬀerences using a paired t-test.

We used 10 fold cross-validation (CV) repeated 10 times and hold-out to gen-
erate results for evaluation. For hold-out, we hold 20% of the data for testing and

are shown in Figure 6 with details in Table 3. The proposed method achieves
about 78% predictive accuracy on average on 100 runs by 10 fold CV repeated
10 times while the baseline method only has less than 76% predictive accuracy
on average, showing the proposed method outperforms the baseline method by
about 2.5% predictive accuracy. For hold-out evaluation, the proposed method
similarly outperforms the baseline method by 2.4% predictive accuracy. The pro-
posed method also outperforms the baseline method in terms of precision, recall
and AUC as shown in Table 3, where the proposed method achieved 3.14%, 0.67%
improvement over the baseline method for precision and recall respectively by 10

baseline method for precision and recall respectively by hold-out. The threshold
selected for this evaluation is based on the optimal operating point selected us-
ing the ROC curve in Figure 7, where the ROC curve of the proposed method
remains above that of the baseline method also indicating the improvement by
the former. On the AUC of the ROC curve, the proposed method outperforms
the baseline method by 2.35%.

method and the compared method are statistically diﬀerent from each other.
The result of a paired t-test on the corresponding predictive accuracy x of the
proposed method and predictive accuracy y of the compared baseline method by
10-fold cross-validation repeated 10 times is shown in Table 4. Here the paired
t-test tests the null hypothesis that data in the diﬀerence x − y are a random
sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and unknown variance, against
the alternative that the mean is not 0, i.e. the null hypothesis that the results
come from populations with equal means, against the alternative that the means
are unequal. Our experiments show that the test rejects the null hypothesis at
the α = 0.05 signiﬁcance level as shown by the hypothesis h = 1 in the table.
Notice that the 95% conﬁdence interval on the diﬀerence mean contains a positive
interval that does not contain 0, which indicates that the mean of the predictive
accuracy of the proposed method is greater than that of the baseline method.
Moreover, the p value has fallen below α = 0.05 and in fact even below α = 0.01,
which can be considered as a very signiﬁcant diﬀerence (signiﬁcant improvement
in accuracy).

6 Conclusion

We have presented a learning framework for the heterogeneous and reciprocal
link prediction problem. To the best of our knowledge, this the ﬁrst work to
address the link sign prediction problem in heterogeneous and reciprocal social
networks. The improvement gained by the proposed approach has been clearly
demonstrated by a set of extensive experiments. The experiments were conducted
in demanding real world datasets collected from a commercial social network
site, which shows that the proposed method is able to make heterogeneous and
reciprocal link predictions and outperforms the use of existing link prediction
techniques.

Future work will include investigating methods to use better collaborative in-
formation and understand the way that the collaborative information contributes
to the prediction in order to design and make use of improved features.
