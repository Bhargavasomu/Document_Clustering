Abstract. The problem of diversifying search results has attracted much
attention, since diverse results can provide non-redundant information
and cover multiple query-related topics. However, existing approaches
typically assign equal importance to each topic. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel method for diversiﬁcation: proportionally diversifying search
results. Speciﬁcally, we study the problem of returning a top-k ranked
list where the number of candidates in each topic is proportional to the
popularity degree of that topic with respect to the query. We obtain such
a top-k proportionally diverse list by maximizing our proposed objective
function and we prove that this is an NP-hard problem. We further pro-
pose a greedy heuristic to eﬃciently obtain a good approximate solution.
To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of our model, we also propose a novel metric
based on the concept of proportionality. Extensive experimental evalua-
tions over our proposed metric as well as standard measures demonstrate
the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our method.

Introduction

Diversiﬁcation models for search results [14,3,7,23,20,22] have attracted much
attention since they can eﬀectively identify possible aspects of the query and
return documents for each aspect. In many cases, this is more useful than con-
ventional search methods which focus on ﬁnding the top-k most relevant docu-
ments, often favouring (near) duplicates in the top positions of the ranked list
at the expense of topic diversity. Although methods for ﬁnding a diverse search
result list have been well studied, they primarily address the problem from the
perspective of minimizing redundancy, and promoting lists that contain docu-
ments covering multiple topics. One limitation of these approaches is that they
treat each document equally while overlooking the fact that some topics are
more popular than others; this can result in too much prominence being given
to topics that are unlikely to be interesting to a majority of searchers. Ideally,
the number of documents from each topic should reﬂect the popularity degree
of that topic. Consider the case of recommending a set of 10 musical documents
in a music recommendation system where two topics are considered (e.g., rock

and classical ) with 90% popularity voting for the topic rock and 10% for the
topic classical. For most users, it would be more useful to return a list which
included mainly results related to rock with less results for classical (e.g. 9 rock,
1 classical). Existing approaches to diversiﬁcation would return roughly equal
numbers of results for each topic (i.e. 5 rock, 5 classical), which is less than ideal.
Motivated by this, we aim to better solve the problem of diversiﬁcation by con-
sidering it from a diﬀerent viewpoint: proportionally diversifying search results.
Speciﬁcally, we study the problem of diversifying the top-k representative search
results by respecting the overall popularity degree for each topic; we acheive
this by determining the number of representative documents on each topic pro-
portional to the topic’s popularity by maximizing a novel objective function.
Since the computation of this objective function is NP-hard, the ﬁnal propor-
tionally representative results are obtained by using an eﬀective greedy heuristic
to approximately maximize the objective function.

We evaluate both our method and state-of-the-art approaches by conducting
comparison experiments over standard metrics [7,8,6] for diversity based on re-
dundancy penalization, and our proposed metric, which considers proportional
diversiﬁcation.
Our principal contributions are as follows.

– We present a novel method for diversiﬁcation: proportionally diversifying
search results. Speciﬁcally, a novel objective function is proposed to obtain
the top-k diverse list by considering the popularity degree over each topic.
– We show that ﬁnding the optimal diversiﬁed top-k results by our objective
function is NP-hard. To address that, an eﬃcient greedy heuristic is proposed
with good approximation ratio.

– A novel metric for diversity is proposed to verify our technique from the
perspective of proportion. To demonstrate the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of
our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world database,
which are evaluated by standard metrics and our proposed metric.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Related work is brieﬂy reviewed in
Section 2. We formulate the problem into a combinatorial optimization problem
and show its potential to ﬁnd a proportionally diverse ranking list in Section
3. We present the objective function and near-optimal algorithm in Section 4.
Then, in Section 5, we report the experimental studies. Section 6 provides the
conclusion.

2 Related Work

There has been rising interest in incorporating diversity into search results to
meet the diverse requirements of users by both covering a large range of topics
as well as preserving relevance. Standard diversiﬁcation techniques [3,2,21,17,16]
attempt to form a diverse ranked list by repeatedly selecting documents that
are diﬀerent to the selected items. One of the typical techniques is “Maximal

392

L. Wu et al.

Marginal Relevance” (MMR) proposed by Carbonell et al.[3], where each candi-
date is iteratively selected by the MMR objective function until a given condition
is met. MMR was extensively studied by Raﬁei et al.[17], who aimed to ﬁnd the
best strategy for ordering the results such that many users would ﬁnd their rel-
evant documents in the top few slots by formulating a weight vector as facets of
the query were discovered.

Other than the work discussed above, there are many recent works studying
result diversiﬁcation [22,20,1,14,19]. For instance, in [22], the authors proposed
a random-walk-based approach to encourage diversity by assigning absorbing
states to the items that have been selected, which eﬀectively “drags down” the
importance of similar unranked states. In a similar vein, a model based on a
reinforced random-walk is proposed in [14] to automatically balance the rele-
vance and diversity in the top returned answers. Tong et al.[20], propose to
address diversity from an optimization viewpoint which considers relevance and
diversity optimally. Although the experimental results in [20] show improved
performance in terms of diversity, it is still less than ideal in applications where
the awareness of proportional popularity is desirable. The work most relevant
to our own is proposed in [10], where an election-based method is proposed to
address the problem of diversifying searched results proportionally. The method
is divided into two phases. First, it diversiﬁes the topics of all candidates by
an election-based strategy, and then the ﬁnal ranked list is yielded by selecting
an appropriate number of candidates for each topic. However, this method can
lead to some documents in popular topics being irrelevant to the query due to
the separation of topic selection and candidate selection. It aims at diversifying
the topics of all candidate documents rather than the candidate documents in
essence. In contrast, our technique uniﬁes the above phases, and eﬀectively ob-
tains a diverse top-k ranked list taking into account both the popularity degree
of each topic and the relevance of each document to the query.

In this paper, we propose a novel objective function where the ﬁnal top-k
proportionally diversifying search results are obtained by achieving the optimal
set of the function. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to obtain an
eﬀective solution for proportionally diversifying search results in an optimizing
environment.

3 Problem Formulation

In this section, we formulate a description of the problem of proportionally di-

versifying search result as follows. Let Q = {w1, . . . , wn} (n ≥ 1) be a set of
keywords comprising a query, let T = {t1, . . . , tm} be the set of all m topics in
the result of Q, and let U denote the set of all documents. We denote pi to be
the popularity degree of topic ti ∈ T (1 ≤ i ≤ m) in U.

Deﬁnition 1. The ranked list R is a proportional representation of U iﬀ
the number of documents in R within topic ti ∈ T (1 ≤ i ≤ m) is proportional to

An Optimization Method for Proportionally Diversifying Search Results

393

its popularity degree pi. Suppose N (i) is the number of candidates from ti in R,
then we have

N (i)(cid:2)m

j=1 N (j)

(1)

≈

pi(cid:2)m

j=1(pj)

We normally present the top-k elements of R as the result for query Q; the
proportion of documents for each topic in the query result should roughly follow
the the popularity degree for that topic Note that Eq.1 shows that the number
of candidates for each topic in the ﬁnal ranked list is not required to exactly
match the proportion of the popularity degree for that topic. This is because
the relevance between query and each candidate could degenerate if we strictly
adhere to the precise proportions (this is demonstrated in section 5).
Example 1. Consider a document collection U where we assume that 80% of the
documents in U about the “Apple” computer company and 20% are about the
fruit “apple”. In this case, U is associated with two topics. Let R = [R1, R2]
where R1 denotes the set of documents about “Apple” (the company) and R2 is
the set of documents about “apple” (the fruit). In a top-10 ranked result list for
the query “apple”, we would expect roughly 8 results from R1 and 2 results from
R2.

Challenges. There are two challenges to be solved in our framework. The ﬁrst
challenge is how to design an objective set function where the optimal or near-
optimal set can best describe the proportionally diverse ranked list, which is
proportionally representative of the document set. The second challenge is de-
veloping an eﬀectiveness measure; that is, given a proportionally ranking list,
how to quantify its goodness. To solve the above two challenges, we propose
a novel objective set function as well as a metric, both of which are shown in
section 4.

4 Proportionally Diversifying Search Results

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the preliminaries and then describe our novel
objective set function to obtain the top-k ranked list proportionally to the pop-
ularity degree of each topic.

4.1 Preliminaries

As our diversiﬁcation algorithm is developed based on the availability of pair-wise
similarities between documents, we adopt the personalized PageRank technique
to compute the values [11]. Suppose there are n documents in the database
and qi is ith query. We represent qi by a n × 1 vector qi such that qi(i) = 1
and qi(j) = 0 (j (cid:6)= i). The pair-wise similarities from each document dj (for
1 ≤ j ≤ n) to the query di (i.e., qi) can be precalculated by Eq.(2) below and
are denoted by a n × 1 vector ri.

ri = cP

(cid:3)

ri + (1 − c)qi

(2)

394

L. Wu et al.

(cid:3)

P is the row-normalized adjacency matrix (i.e.
j=1 P (i, j) = 1) of the similar-
ities, P
is the transpose of P, c is a damping factor, and ri(j) is the similarity
of j to i. Note that ri(j) is not necessarily equal to rj(i). For each pre-computed
n × 1 vector ri, we use (cid:7)ri(cid:7) to denote the sum of all elements in ri except ri(i);
that is, (cid:7)ri(cid:7) =

(cid:2)n

j=1,j(cid:4)=i ri(j).

(cid:2)n

4.2 Objective Function

Given a set R of k documents, we propose to measure the quality of R, regarding
the relevance to a given query qi0 and the proportional diversity based on the
topic popularity, as follows.

g(R) =

(cid:3)

i∈R

(1 − wi(cid:7)ri(cid:7)

(cid:3)

j∈R,j(cid:4)=i

ri(j))ri0 (i)

(3)

where ri0 (i) is a relevance score; the more relevant each individual document
di is to the query, the higher the value of g(R). Nevertheless, the inclusion of
di in R is penalized against the pair-wise similarities (ri(j)) from document di
to other documents dj in R; that is, subtract wi(cid:6)ri(cid:6)
where ri(j) is large when di and dj have the same topic, which will further reduce
the value of g(R). Thus, g(R) is expected to capture simultaneously the high
closeness and the great diversity by maximizing its value while conﬁrming the
proportionality. Thereby, we aim to eﬃciently retrieve a set R of k documents
such that g(R) is maximized.

j∈R,j(cid:4)=i ri(j) (0 ≤ wi ≤ 1)

(cid:2)

The question here is how to proportionally diversify top-k results? We argue
that it is implemented by wi, which indicates the importance of discounting the
pair-wise similarity to include di in R. Herein, wi determines the topic to be
selected; we call this the topic coeﬃcient. In fact, the proportion for the number
of documents in each topic is guaranteed by automatically updating the topic
coeﬃcient wi, which manages the possibility of declining di provided that many
items belonging to the same topic as di have already been included. Speciﬁcally,
we deﬁne wi as

wi = e1− zi

ui +1

(4)

where zi denotes how many documents that belong to the same topic as di have
been included in R and ui is the number of documents with the topic ti. We
assume that zi is always less then ui in our setting. It is natural to observe
that the larger wi is, the heavier penalty on document di, and it becomes more
diﬃcult for di to be selected.

We now prove that the problem of maximizing g(R) is NP-hard even when all
wi = 1, which is a special case of this optimization problem. To deal with this,
we then propose a near-optimal algorithm with a performance guarantee (i.e.,
accuracy guarantee and time-complexity) regarding a general g(R).

Theorem 1. The problem of retrieving a set R of k documents to maximize
g(R) is NP-hard with respect to k even if all wi = 1 in Eq. (3).

Proof. We convert the decision problem of maximum clique to a special case of
the decision problem of the optimization problem in Theorem 1.
Decision Problem of Maximum Clique (MC)
INSTANCE: Given a graph G with n vertices, and an integer k ≤ n
2 .
QUESTION: Is there a complete subgraph of G with size k?

It is well known that the maximum clique problem is NP-hard [13]; thus, its

decision problem, above, is NP-complete regarding k.
Proof of Theorem 1. For each instance (i.e. G and k) in MC, we construct r as
follows. Suppose that the query has label 0 and each vertex vi ∈ G corresponds
to a document i. For each vertex vi ∈ G (1 ≤ i ≤ n), we assign r0(i) = 1
n and
ri(0) = 0 (note r is not always symmetric); clearly, r0(0) should be 1. Then, for
each edge (vi, vj) ∈ G, we assign ri(j) = rj(i) = 0, and for each pair of vertices
vi and vj which are not connected by an edge in G, we assign ri(j) = rj(i) = 1
n2 .
Then, based on a preliminary calculation, it can be immediately veriﬁed that
g(R) ≥ 1 with |R| = k if and only if the following two conditions hold:
1. R contains the query with label 0; and
2. R contains a complete subgraph, with (k − 1) vertices, of G. Note that the

(k − 1) vertices correspond to the k − 1 documents.

4.3 Eﬃcient Near-Optimal Algorithm

Theorem 1 shows that retrieving a set of k documents to maximize g(R) is NP-
hard. The function g(R) is submodular and [15] states that a greedy algorithm
to maximize a submodular function has the approximation ratio ( e−1
e ). Our
algorithm (see Algorithm 1) is a greedy algorithm, for which we increase the
value of topic coeﬃcient wj if some documents belonging to the same topic tj
have already been included in R. The set R resists document dj with higher value
of wj while it prefers document dh(1 ≤ h ≤ n) if its topic coeﬃcient is lower.
Furthermore, when the maximum number of a topic is reached (e.g. zi = ui), the
corresponding topic coeﬃcient is set to be a prohibitive value Ω. Setting wi = Ω
in Eq. (3) ensures that we reject any further documents which have topic ti. A
suitable value of Ω was determined via our empirical studies.

According to the Proposition 4.3 in [15], the greedy algorithm of diversiﬁca-

tion has the following accuracy guarantee.
Theorem 2. The greedy algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of ( e−1
the submodular function of diversiﬁcation with proportionality constraint.

4.4 Proposed Metric

Observing that most existing metrics measure diversity by explicitly penalizing
redundancy over each returned document while maintaining relevance, we pro-
pose a novel metric that considers the proportionality on the diversiﬁed search

results by extending the metric in [10]. The metric proposed in [10] considers
the following principles: First, each document need not belong to just one aspect
of the query; that is, a document might be related to multiple aspects. Second,
selecting a document that is related to some topics which already have enough
relevant documents should be evaluated better than a non-relevant document. In
other words, non-relevant documents should not be evaluated as highly as over-
selection. However, the metric in [10] ignores the importance of rank positions of
documents. Therefore, another critical property should be added: non-relevant
documents appearing at earlier rank positions should be evaluated worse than
relevant documents in later positions.

Considering the above three principles and least square index (LSq) [12],
which is a standard metric for measuring dis-proportionality, we formulate our
metric as Eq.(5) for penalizing the dis-proportionality for each rank position
L(1 ≤ L ≤ k):

DP @L =

where ui indicates the number of documents relevant to topic ti, vi is the number
of documents that are actually found for ti, Y denotes the number of non-relevant
documents at positions 1..L. The coeﬃcient ci on topic ti is deﬁned as follows:

(cid:4)

1, ui ≥ vi;
0, otherwise.

ci =

(6)

We now brieﬂy discuss how our metric satisﬁes the aforementioned three prin-
ciples. Our metric addresses the ﬁrst principle associated with metric design by
penalizing a list for under-selecting (vi ≤ ui) on some topics but not for over-
selecting (vi ≥ ui) on it. At the same time, non-relevant aspects are penalized

An Optimization Method for Proportionally Diversifying Search Results

397

(Y ≥ 0) while over-selecting is not, which meets the second principle. Finally,
the third principle of rank positions is implemented by considering the positions
that are occupied by the non-relevant documents in the top-k diverse ranked list.
To make the metric comparable across queries, we normalize the proportionality
measure as follows:

P M @L = 1 − DP @L
i + L

In the end, the proportionality diversiﬁcation metric for a ranked list R can be
computed as follows:

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the eﬀectiveness
and eﬃciency of our algorithms. The setting of experiment is introduced in
section 5.1, followed by the study of parameter learning in section 5.2. Then
elaborate evaluations are presented in section 5.3.

5.1 Experimental Setup

Baseline Diversity Models. We implemented the model described above,
along with four other diversity models as baselines. The ﬁrst diversity model
is MMR [3], which has been widely considered standard in diversity literature.
Another model, xQuAD [18], uses a probabilistic framework which determines
how well each document satisﬁes each topic and outperforms many others in
the task of diversitﬁcation. The third model, proposed by Dang et al.[10], is
referred to as Election in our experiment, and uses an election-based approach
to address the problem of search result diversiﬁcation. Finally, we implemented
the approach of Dragon, which captures relevance and diversity in an optimized
way [20].
Query and Topic Collection. There are 50 queries in our query set, which
come from the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web Track [5]. To obtain the
relevant documents for each query, we adopt the query-likelihood framework to
conduct the relevance search [9]. The evaluation is conducted on the ClueWeb09
Category B retrieval collection 1, which contains 50 million webpages. As our ap-
proach and xQuAD require the availability of query topics and their popularity,
we utilize the sub-topics provided by TREC as aspects for each query. Since the
popularity of each topic is not available in TREC data, we follow the model in
[18] by adopting suggestions provided by a search engine as topic representation.

Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate our approach and baseline models in terms
of the proportionality metric proposed in Section 4. Considering that the propor-
tion metric is specialized towards our model, we also report performance using
several standard metrics including α-NDCG[7], ERR [4] and NRBP [8].

5.2 Parameter Learning

Parameter learning aims to determine “optimal” values for Ω and k. The Ω
measure is speciﬁc to our approach, and we evaluate precision and recall using
Ω values ranging from 5 to 25. Fig.1 shows that our model achieves the best
results when Ω has the value of 15. The k measure applies to all algorithms, and
we need to ensure that we do not choose a k value that is biassed towards any
particular approach. Fig.2 shows that all approaches perform best with a value
of k around 40. Thereby, we conduct the diversiﬁcation search with a ranked list
of 40 documents.

5.3 Performance Evaluations

Metrics and Proportionality Evaluations. We ﬁrst compared our proposed
technique to MMR, xQuAD, Dragon and Election using our proportional metric
P M (R) for a list of R. From Fig.3 (a), we can see that our technique outperforms
the other four, which demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of our method at preserving
proportionality. Secondly, we conducted comparisons in terms of three standard
metrics from the diversity literature: α-NDCG, ERR and NRBP. The results are
reported in Fig.3 (b) to (d), from which we can observe the similar result as in
the previous example with proportional metric. Speciﬁcally, MMR is the least
eﬀective because of its ignorance of query topics. On the other hand, our method
outperforms greatly over all the other method on almost all metrics. Note that
these measures are computed using top 20 documents retrieved by each model,
which is consistent with the standard TREC evaluations [5].

As all algorithms rank the top-k retrieved documents according to diﬀerent
principles, we examine the performance in both precision and sub-topic recall.
We summarize the results in Table 1, which suggest that documents returned
by MMR are more relevant and Election covers more topics than others. How-
ever, in terms of suggestions, i.e., the representation of popularity on retrieved
documents, our model achieves better performance than the other four.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a novel technique to address the problem of propor-
tionally diversifying search results. A novel objective function is proposed to
obtain a top-k ranked list by maximizing the value of the function. We prove
that obtaining the optimal maximal value with respect to the proposed objective
function is NP-hard, and resolve this by proposing an eﬃcient greedy heuristic.
We also propose a metric (P M (R)) to measure how eﬀectively a diversiﬁca-
tion algorithm captures proportionality. Our experimental studies, evaluated on
both standard metrics and our proposed metric, validate that our algorithm is
not only able to eﬀectively balance the relevance and diversity of search results,
but is also capable of keeping approximate proportionality of the top-k search
