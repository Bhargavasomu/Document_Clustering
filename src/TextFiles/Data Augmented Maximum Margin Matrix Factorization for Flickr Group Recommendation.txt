Abstract. User groups on photo sharing websites, such as Flickr, are
self-organized communities to share photos and conversations with sim-
ilar interest and have gained massive popularity. However, the huge vol-
ume of groups brings troubles for users to decide which group to choose.
Further, directly applying collaborative ﬁltering techniques to group rec-
ommendation will suﬀer from cold start problem since many users do not
aﬃliate to any group. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommendation
approach named Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Factoriza-
tion (DAM3F), by integrating collaborative user-group information and
user similarity graph. Speciﬁcally, Maximum Margin Matrix Factoriza-
tion (MMMF) is employed for the collaborative recommendation, while
the user similarity graph obtained from the user uploaded images and
annotated tags is used as an complementary part to handle the cold
start problem and to improve the performance of MMMF. The experi-
ments conducted on our crawled dataset with 2196 users, 985 groups and
334467 images from Flickr demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed
approach.

Introduction

With the dramatic development of Web 2.0 and social network technologies,
social media become more and more important as a way for users to obtain
valuable information, express individual opinions, share experiences as well as
keep in touch with friends. Online photo sharing sites, such as Flickr 1 and Picasa
Web Album2, become popular with numerous images uploaded every day (over
6 billion images in Flickr ) [18]. User groups on such sites are self-organized
communities to share photos and conversations with similar interest and have
gained massive popularity. Joining groups facilitates ﬂexibility in indexing and
managing self photos, making them more accessible to the public and searching
photos and users with similar interests. As the support of above view, Negoescu
et al. provide an in-depth analysis of the structure of Flickr groups and the
motivation of group activities [10][11].

Although the information contributed by user groups could greatly improve
the user’s browsing experience and enrich the social connections, the real situa-
tion is that many users rarely join in any group. By studying 3 million images
and the respective users and groups crawled from Flickr, we discover an inter-
esting fact that only 6.7% users have ever joined one image group and only 1.9%
users have joined more than 5 groups. Thus, it is necessary to design a recom-
mendation approach that could automatically recommend appropriate groups
for users.

Group recommendation for photo sharing sites is a relatively novel scenario
that have not been systematically studied. Current works commonly employs tra-
ditional recommendation techniques such as collaborative ﬁltering [9] and matrix
factorization [7,15] to recommend groups in a collaborative way. However, the
recommendation performances of current work are not satisﬁed enough, due to
two following points which are not yet considered carefully:

– Sparse User-Group Matrix. As discussed above, many users rarely join
in any group. According to the statistic of our crawled dataset, the density of
the user-group relationship matrix is only 0.46%. Simply implementing state-
of-the-art recommendation techniques on such sparse dataset can’t achieve
satisﬁed result.

– Cold Start Problem. It should be noted that the cold-start problem in
this paper means recommending groups to the users haven’t joined in any
group. The sparse user-group matrix makes it more diﬃcultly to handle the
cold-start problem.

As an early explorer in group recommendation for online photo sharing sites,
we propose a hybrid recommendation approach named Data Augmented Maxi-
mum Margin Matrix Factorization (DAM3F) to handle the above two problems,
by integrating collaborative user-group relationship and user similarity graph.
On one hand, Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) [17] is adopted
for collaborative recommendation, by jointly learning the latent factors of users
and groups from the original user-group relationship. As an improvement of tra-
dition matrix factorization approaches, Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization
uses hinge loss instead of sum-square loss and has been proven to be an eﬀec-
tive approach for collaborative recommendation on sparse dataset. On the other
hand, the user similarity graph obtained from the user uploaded images and an-
notated tags is used as an complementary part to handle the cold start problem
and to improve the performance of MMMF. Speciﬁcally, graph regularization is
introduced to preserve the user similarity, which provides a more interpretable
way to characterize the users and groups. Further, a novel objective function is
proposed which jointly consider the above issues, and an eﬃcient optimization
algorithm is provided to solve the objective function.

In particular, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as

follows:

1. This paper proposes a hybrid approach named DAM3F to handle the sparse
user-group matrix and cold-start problems in Flickr group recommendation.

2. A novel objective function is proposed by jointly considering the collabora-

tive user-group information and the user similarity graph.

3. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a real-world dataset
consists of 2196 users, 985 groups and 334467 images is crawled from Flickr.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outper-
forms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of six well-known evaluation
metrics.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a survey of
related work in group recommendation. Section 3 shows the details of the pro-
posed approach for Flickr group recommendation, while Section 4 reports the
performance of DAM3F based on real-world dataset. Finally Section 5 concludes
this paper.

2 Related Work

User groups on social Websites, are self-organized communities to share pho-
tos and conversations with similar interest and have gained massive popularity.
Group recommendation is an important paradigm that discovering the inter-
esting groups for users, and attracts a lot of attention in recent years. In this
section, we brieﬂy introduce the related work in this area, by classifying them
into three categories according to the employed approaches.

– Content-based recommendation: This category of methods recommends
a group to a user based on the content of user or group, e.g., description
of the group, the proﬁle of the users interests, etc. Sihem et al. utilize the
user proﬁles and propose a formal semantics that accounts for both item
relevance to a group and disagreements among group members [1]. Liu et al.
propose a tag-based group recommendation method on Flicker dataset by
building a tag ranking system [8]. Kim et al. represent items with keyword
features by a content-based ﬁltering algorithm, and propose a community
recommendation procedure for online readers [6].

– Collaborative ﬁltering based recommendation: This category of meth-
ods was successfully applied in traditional recommender systems, and is
based on the assumption that similar users are likely to attend similar groups.
Chen et al. propose an improved collaborative ﬁltering method named com-
binational collaborative ﬁltering(CCF), which considers multiple types of co-
occurrences in social data and recommends personal communities [4]. Zheng
et al. implement several collaborative ﬁltering methods, and provide a sys-
tematic experimental evaluation on Flicker group recommendation [20]. Yu
et al. propose a collaborative ﬁltering recommendation algorithm for Web
communities, in which the latent links between communities and members
are utilized to handle the sparsity problem [12].

– Hybrid recommendation: This category of methods combines several al-
gorithms to recommend groups. Chen et al. compare association rule mining

476

L. Chen et al.

(ARM) and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) for the community recommen-
dation, and ﬁnd that LDA performs consistently better than ARM when
recommending a list of more than 4 communities [3]. Chen et al. design a
group recommendation system based on collaborative ﬁltering, and employ
genetic algorithm to predict the possible interactions among group members
[5]. This strategy makes the estimated rating that a group of members might
give to a group more correct. Zheng et al. propose a tensor decomposition
model for Flickr group recommendation, which measures the latent relations
between users and groups by considering both tags and users social relations
[19]. Zheng et al. also propose an approach which combines the topic model
and collaborative ﬁltering, and this method is demonstrated to have better
performance than traditional CF and negative matrix factorization [18].

The proposed approach DAM3F in the paper is a hybrid one, in which we
take the advantage of the above related works (e.g., user-annotated tags are
utilized), and introduce some novel data (i.e., visual features extracted from
the uploaded images) to further improve the performance of recommendation.
In the technology aspect, we extend the traditional MMMF, and propose a
novel objective function in which both user-group relationship and user similarity
graph are considered. Further, an eﬃcient optimization approach is proposed to
solve the objective function.

3 DAM3F Based Flickr Group Recommendation

In this section, we show the details of Data Augmented Maximum Margin Ma-
trix Factorization (DAM3F), which is the extension of the classical Maximum
Margin Matrix Factorization approach by taking the uploaded images and user-
annotated tags into consideration. To begin with, we give the main framework
of DAM3F in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. The main framework of the proposed DAM3F. The user-group relationship and
user similarity graph are integrated in Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Fac-
torization framework to obtain the user and group latent factor matrices. Speciﬁcally,
the similarity graph is computed based on the features extracted from images and
annotated tags. Then the recommendation results can be calculated from the latent
factors of users and groups.

3.1 Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization
Given the sets of M users, N images and P groups respectively, R ∈ RM×P is
the aﬃliation matrix between users and groups, where Rij = 1 means that the
ith user is the member of the jth group and 0 otherwise. Furthermore, we use
matrix S ∈ RM×N to denote the ownership between users and images where
Sik = 1 indicates that the kth image is uploaded by the ith user. By extracting
the D dimension visual feature of the N images, we obtain the image feature
matrix X = [x1, x2, . . . , xN ]T ∈ RN×D. Given the information above, the aims
of group recommendation is to recover a new aﬃliation matrix Rrec denote the
relationship between users and groups, and more importantly to recommend new
groups to users based on Rrec.
The traditional matrix factorization approaches for recommendation tries to
factorize the aﬃliation matrix R into two M×K and N×K dimensional low-rank
matrices U and G by:

(cid:3) R − U GT (cid:3)F +λ((cid:3) U (cid:3)F + (cid:3) G (cid:3)F ),

(1)

argmin

U,G

where (cid:3) · (cid:3)F denotes the Frobenius norm and K is dimensionality of the latent
factors of both users and groups. Besides, the regularization penalties λ((cid:3) U (cid:3)F
+ (cid:3) G (cid:3)F ) is utilized to avoid over-ﬁtting. Afterwards, the recommendation

results can be obtained by calculating similarity between the latent factors of
users and groups as Rrec = U GT .

As for our group recommendation problem, Rrecij only has two entries, i.e. 0
and 1, which indicates whether the ith user aﬃliates to the jth group. Therefore,
comparing with traditional recommendation techniques which obtain the rating
matrix, group recommendation is more appropriate to be formulated as a binary
classiﬁcation problem. Besides, since there are much more 0’s than 1’s in matrix
R, the resulting recommendation results will be heavily biased towards 0 by
using traditional matrix factorization approaches.

In order to overcome such limitations, Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization
(MMMF) is proposed by replacing the sum-squared loss with hinge loss which has
been widely used in classiﬁcation application, such as Support Vector Machines.
According to [13][17], the objective function of MMMF can be written as:

h(R − U GT ) + λ((cid:3) U (cid:3)F + (cid:3) G (cid:3)F ),

(2)

argmin

U,G

where h(z) = (1 − z)+ = max(0, 1 − z) corresponds to the hinge loss.

Above formulation can be also interpreted as simultaneous learning of feature
vectors and linear classiﬁers. By viewing matrix U as the feature vectors of the
users, matrix G can be regarded as linear classiﬁers that map the user feature
vectors into binary labels that indicate whether the user is interested in that
group. In addition, hinge loss is adopted for learning maximum margin classiﬁers
with respect to each group.

3.2 Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization

Similar to other collaborative ﬁltering algorithms, MMMF based recommenda-
tion still suﬀers cold-start problem, i.e., recommendation results for new users
who have not joined groups tend to be very inaccurate. This problem could be
solved, to some extent, by exploiting content information of the users, i.e., the
features extracted from their uploaded images and the corresponding annotated
tags. The basic assumption is: if two users have joined in the same group, then
their uploaded images to this group will probably be visually similar or semanti-
cally (tag-based) similar. Based on this assumption, we can incorporate such user
similarity graph into the MMMF based recommendation framework. Firstly, the
feature vector fi w.r.t. the ith user can be calculated by averaging the feature
vectors of all his images or tags as:

fi =

(cid:2)

j=1

,

(3)

where Sij denotes the jth image uploaded by ui, Xj means the visual or semantic
(tag-based) feature of Sij . It should be noted that the process of feature extrac-
tion is introduced in Section 4.1. Then we can construct the adjacency matrix
W of the user similarity graph as follows:

exp(

if xj ∈ N (xi) or xi ∈ N (xj )

otherwise,

(4)

where N (xi) denotes the k-nearest neighbor of xi and the Heat Kernel is ex-

ploited to measure the similarity of two feature vectors. To guarantee that users
who upload visually or semantically similar images will also obtain similar latent
factors, we introduce the following graph regularization term:

By leveraging the collaborating information and user similarity graph, we
propose the Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (DAM3F)
framework, which uniﬁes maximum margin matrix factorization and graph
regularization as:

h(R − U GT ) + μtr(U T (γL1 + (1 − γ)L2)U ) + λ((cid:3) U (cid:3)F + (cid:3) G (cid:3)F ) (6)

argmin

where μ is the trade-oﬀ parameter between collaborating information and con-
tent information, L1 is the Laplacian matrix of the image based user similarity
graph (visually), L2 is the Laplacian matrix of the tag based user similarity graph
(semantically), and γ is the trade-oﬀ parameter between visual information and
tag information.

Although the proposed objective function is not a convex function of U and G,
but it is convex to one variable when the other one is ﬁxed. Therefore, we could
obtain the local optimal solution by alternatively updating the two variables
using gradient descent methods.

Denoting the objective function as J(U, G), we can calculate the gradient of

J(U, G). The partial derivative with respect to U is:

∂J

∂U = −h(cid:4)

(R − U GT )G + 2μ(γL1 + (1 − γ)L2)U + 2λU

The partial derivative with respect to G is:

∂J

∂G = −h(cid:4)

(R − U GT )T U + 2λG

(7)

(8)

Since the hinge loss function h(z) is non-smooth at z = 1, following [13],
we adopt smooth hinge instead of hinge loss for the ease of optimization. The
further details of optimization process is omitted due to the space limitation.

4 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on the
real-world dataset crawled from Flickr by using kinds of metrics, and compare
it with state-of-the-art approaches. Sepciﬁcally, all experiments are conducted
on a windows workstation with Intel 2.67GHz Xeon CPU and 32GB RAM by
using Matlab 8.0.

4.1 Experiment Setup

To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we collect an image
dataset from Flickr by using its API3. The details of this dataset could be found
in Table 1. To obtain this dataset, we ﬁrst select popular groups in Flickr by
keyword searching. Then, active users of these groups and their uploaded images
as well as the annotated tags are crawled, respectively. As for the process of
feature extraction, we extract 81-dimensional color histogram/moments feature
and 37-dimensional edge histogram feature to generate the visual feature to
represent these images by using FELib4, and employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) to generate 50-dimensional semantic feature to represent the annotated

details of the tag-based feature extraction.
To evaluate the performance of group recommendation, we randomly sample
α× 100% of the user-group assignments from the user-group aﬃliation matrix to
generate the matrix R for training and use the full user-group aﬃliation matrix
as the ground-truth for evaluation.

Evaluation Metrics. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed approach, we consider the following evaluation metrics: Precision@k (P@k),
Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [2], Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), and F1 score. In particular, k is chosen to 5 and 10 for
P@k metric.

4.2 Recommendation Performance Comparison

In order to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach, we imple-
ment the following approaches and compare the performances:

1. CB: Content based recommendation by using the user similarity graph.
2. CF: Collaborative Filtering

recommendation by using user-group

relationship [14].

3. SVD: Singular Value Decomposition based recommendation by using user-

group relationship[9].

4. NMF: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization based recommendation by using

user-group relationship[15].

5. MMMF: Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization based recommendation

by using user-group relationship[17].

6. DAM3Ftag: One version of the proposed DAM3F in this paper, while only

sematic (tag-based) user similarity graph is combined to MMMF.

Data Augmented MMMF for Flickr Group Recommendation

481

7. DAM3Fvisual: One version of the proposed DAM3F in this paper, while

only visual user similarity graph is combined to MMMF.

In this experiment, parameter μ is set empirically to 1 and λ is set to 0.1.
The dimensionality of latent factors K is set to 200. It should be noted that the
parameters of all the competitive methods have been fairly tuned using cross-
validate, and the average evaluation results after 10-fold cross-validation are
selected.

Table 2 shows the performance comparison of above group recommendation
approaches when α = 60% in terms of multiple evaluation metrics. From Table
2, it can be observed that the two versions of DAM3F largely outperform the
other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple metrics. The superior per-
formance of the proposed approach comes from two aspects, one is the selection
of hinge loss for matrix factorization, while the other one is the integration of
user similarity graph. Further, it can be discovered that the DAM3Fvisual out-
performs DAM3Ftag. The reason is two-fold: 1) extracted visual feature is more
explicit than the semantic (tag-based) feature; 2) User-annotated tags are in-
herent uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized. Thus, a pre-processing
should be implemented before adopting user-annotated tags. In the following
experiments, we implement a tag recommendation process to smooth the dis-
tribution of tagging data, and the performance comparison could be found in
Section 4.4.

Figure 2 shows the group recommendation performance comparison of diﬀer-
ent approaches while the proportion of training data α varies from 20% to 80%
in terms of MAP. The superior performance at diﬀerent α further veriﬁed the
eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, it can be observed that the
two versions of DAM3F are of greater advantage than other approaches when α
gets smaller. The reason is that the user similarity regularization plays a more
important role when the initial aﬃliation matrix is sparse, which is consistent
with our motivation.

4.3 Performance Evaluation of DAM3F

In the proposed DAM3F, we utilize both visual feature extracted from uploaded
images and semantic feature extracted from annotated tags. In the above experi-
ment, we implement two versions of DAM3F, in each only one feature is utilized.
In this section, we evaluate the performance of DAM3F by utilizing these two
features, and evaluate the impact of trade-oﬀ parameter γ to performance of
DAM3F in terms of multiple metrics.

Figure 3 shows the performance of DAM3F and the impact of γ to it. The ap-
proach is DAM3Ftag when γ=0, while the approach is DAM3Fvisual when γ=1.
From Fig. 3, it could be observed that DAM3F outperforms both DAM3Ftag and
DAM3Fvisual in terms of all metrics. It can be easily explained that the increase
of relevant feature improves the performance of recommendation. Further, it
could be found that the optimal value of γ is diﬀerent for diﬀerent metric. Thus,
the selection strategy of the optimal value of γ should be adjusted according to
the application scenario.

4.4 Impact of Tag Recommendation to DAM3F

As discussed above, user-annotated tags are inherent uncontrolled, ambiguous,
and overly personalized. Thus, a pre-processing should be implemented before
adopting user-annotated tags. In this section, we implement two commonly ac-
cepted tag recommendation approach, i.e., Sum and V ote [16], to recommend
relevant tags to the images with few tags and to delete irrelevant tags for the
purpose of smoothing the tagging data distribution.

Table 3 show the performance comparison of DAM3F with diﬀerent tag rec-
ommendation approaches in terms of multiple metrics. From Table 3, it can

be observed that the introduction of tag recommendation process improves the
performance of DAM3F in terms of all metrics. It can be easily understood as
the irrelevant tags don’t contribute to the representation of the uploaded images
or even have negative eﬀect, while the addition of relevant tags improves the
representation quality of the tag-based feature.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for Flickr group recommendation
by leveraging traditional collaborative recommendation with user similarity reg-
ularization. More speciﬁcally, the proposed Data Augmented Maximum Margin
Matrix Factorization (DAM3F) approach integrates the maximum margin ma-
trix factorization with the user similarity graph calculated from their uploaded
images and the annotated tags. Experiments implemented on the real-world
dataset crawled from Flickr demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach, by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple
metrics. As a general framework, DAM3F can be also applied to other recom-
mendation tasks.

In our future work, we will try to employ more personal and contextual infor-
mation of Flickr users in the framework of DAM3F for the purpose of improving
group recommendation performance.
