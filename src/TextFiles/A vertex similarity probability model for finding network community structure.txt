Abstract. Most methods for finding community structure are based on the prior 
knowledge of network structure type. These methods grouped the communities 
only when known network is unipartite or bipartite. This paper presents a vertex 
similarity probability (VSP) model which can find community structure without 
priori  knowledge  of  network  structure  type.  Vertex  similarity,  which  assumes 
that, for any type of network structures, vertices in the same community have 
similar  properties.  In  the  VSP  model,  “Common  neighbor  index”  is  used  to 
measure the vertex similarity probability, as it has been proved to be an effective 
index for vertex similarity. We apply the algorithm to real-world network data. 
The results show that the VSP model is uniform for both unipartite networks and 
bipartite  networks,  and  it  is  able  to  find  the  community  structure  successfully 
without the use of the network structure type.   

Keywords:  community  structure,  type  of  the  network  structure,  vertex 
similarity, common neighbor index.

Introduction 

As part of the recent surge of research on large, complex networks, attention has been 
devoted to the computational analysis of complex networks [1-4]. Complex networks, 
such as social networks and biological networks, are all highly dynamic objects which 
grow and change quickly over time. These networks have a common feature, namely 
“community structure”. Communities, also known as clusters or modules, are groups of 
vertices  which  could  share  common  properties  and/or  have  similar  roles  within  the 
graph [5]. Finding community structure and clustering vertices in the complex network, 
is  key  to  learning  a  complex  network  topology,  to  understanding  complex  network 
functions,  to  founding  hidden  mode,  to  link  prediction,  and  to  evolution  detection. 
Through the analysis of community structure, researchers have achieved a lot results, 
such as in [6, 7], V. Spirin et al. revealed the relationship between protein function and 
interactions inherent; in [8, 9], Flake et al. found the internal relations of hyperlink and 
the main page; in [10, 11], Moody et al. identified the social organizations to evolve 
over time and so on.

The  most  popular  method  for  finding  community  structure  is  the  modularity 
matrix  method  [12,  13]  proposed  by  Newman  et  al.  which  is  based  on  spectral 
clustering. The Modularity model proves that, if the type of the network structure is 
known, modularity optimization is able to find community structure in both unipartite 
and  bipartite  networks  by  the  maximum  or  minimum  eigenvalue  separately.  Then, 
some scientists have sought to detect the community in bipartite networks like Michael 
J. Barber [14]. BRIM proposed by Barber and his colleagues can determine the number 
of communities of a bipartite network. Furthermore, in [15], Barber and Clark use the 
label-propagation  algorithm  (LPA)  for  identifying  network  communities.  However, 
[14, 15] can not be used without knowing the type of network. 

There are other  methods to  find community  structure. Hierarchical clustering is 
adopted frequently in finding community structures, in which vertices are grouped into 
communities that further are subdivided into smaller communities, and so forth, as in 
[12]. Clauset, Moore and Newman propose HRG [16] using the maximum likelihood 
estimation  to  forecast  the  probability  of  connections  between  vertices.  Hierarchical 
methods perform remarkably in clear hierarchy network, but not so impressive under 
contrary  circumstance.  Moreover,  a  hierarchical  method  always  has  high 
computational complexity. In 2009, Roger Guimera and Marta Sales-Pardo proposed a 
stochastic block model [17] based on HRG. Different from traditional concept which 
divide network by principle of “inside connection dense outside sparse”, in [17], the 
probability that two vertices are connected depends on the blocks to which they belong. 
However,  the  assumption  that  vertices  in  same  blocks  have  same  connection 
probability  is  not  accurate.  Recently,  Karrer  and  Newman  [18]  also  proposed  a 
stochastic block model which considers the variation in vertex degree. This stochastic 
block model solves the heterogeneous vertex degrees problem and got a better result 
than other previous researches without degree correction. It can be used in both types of 
networks, but different types of networks should be dealt with separately none the less. 
In some cases, researchers have no priori knowledge of the network structure. For 
example, when we know the interaction of vertex in the protein network, we may have 
no knowledge of the network structure type. Moreover, when we get a network which 
consists of people’s relationships in schools, the type of network may not be sure. It is 
because  that  if  links  only  exist  between  students,  the  network  will  be  a  unipartite 
network; or if links exist between students and teachers, the network will be a bipartite 
one. An effective method used for finding community structure in both unipartite and 
bipartite networks is needed.   

It  is  discussed  before  that  most  methods  deal  with  the  unipartite  network  or 
bipartite  network  separately,  because  the  properties  of  networks  are  different  in 
different types of the network structure. Unipartite networks assume that connections 
between the vertices in same community are dense, and between the communities are 
sparse, such as Social network [19], biochemical network [20] and information network 
[21]. However, some real  networks are bipartite  with edges joining only vertices of 
different  communities,  such  as  shopping  networks  [22],  protein-protein  interaction 
networks [23], plant-animal mutualistic networks [24], scientific publication networks 
[25], etc. Although the properties of “edges” in the two types of networks are different, 
vertices  in  the  same  communities  should  be  similar  because  vertices  in  same 

458  K. Li and Y. Pang 

communities have similar properties. In this paper, we develop a uniform VSP model 
which is based on the vertex similarity. Therefore, the VSP model can be used in any 
type of networks as long as we put similar vertices in same communities. The VSP 
model gets ideal result both by theoretical proof and experimental analysis.   

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we prove vertex similarity theory is 
suitable for finding community structure. We present the VSP model and the method to 
group network into two communities in section 3. In section 4, we make the experiment 
in  both  unipartite  and  bipartite  network.  Compared  with  Newman’s  modularity,  the 
VSP model is an accurate uniform model which can find community structure without 
prior knowledge of type of the network structure. Finally, we draw our conclusions.

Vertex Similarity in Finding Community Structure 

The concept of community informs that vertices in the same community should share 
common properties no matter in unipartite or bipartite network. It means that vertices in 
the same community should be similar, although edges in different type of the network 
structures  are  connected  in  different  ways.  Therefore,  we  change  our  focus  from 
“edges” to “vertices” for finding communities. 

Vertex  similarity  is  widely  studied  by  researchers  in  complex  network.  It  is 
sometimes called structural similarity, to distinguish it from social similarity, textual 
similarity, or other similarity types. It is a basic premise of research on networks that 
the  structure  of  a  network  reflects  real  information  about  the  vertices  the  network 
connects, so it is reasonable that meaningful structural similarity measures might exist 
[26]. In general, if two vertices have a number of common neighbors, we believe that 
these  two  vertices  are  similar.  In  community  detection,  we  assume  that  two  similar 
vertices have similar properties and should be grouped in the same community. 

Γ   be the neighborhood of vertex x in a network, i.e., the set of vertices that 
Γ ∩ Γ is  the  number  of  common 

are  directly  connected  to  x  via  an  edge.  Then

Let 

x

x

y

neighbors of x and y. Common neighbor index, Salton index, Jaccard index, Sorenson 
index, LHN (Leicht-Holme-Newman) index, and Adamic-Adar index [27-31] are five 
famous methods for vertex similarity. Many researchers have analyzed and compared 
these  methods.  Liben-Nowell[32]  and  Zhou  Tao[33]  proved  that  the  simplest 
measurement “common neighbor index” performs surprisingly well. We use “common 
neighbor index” to measure the vertex similarity in our VSP model. 

Definition 1. For two vertices x and y, if there is a vertex z to be the neighbor of x 
and  y at the same time,  we call  x and  y a pair, denoted as pair(x,  y).  z is called the 
common neighbor of pair(x, y). 

Since vertices which are in the same community have similar properties, we assume 
vertices  in  the  same  community  are  similar  vertices.  The  more  similar  the  vertices 
inside  a  community  are  the  more  common  neighbors  they  have.  The  number  of 
common neighbors

2.1  Common Neighbor Index in Unipartite Network 

For  a  unipartite  network,  the  basic  community  detection  principle  is  “edges  inside 
communities  are  dense,  outside  are  sparse”.  Let  the  sum  of  edges  with  vertices  in 
different communities is outA , where

which is formed by j and a neighbor of i. In a unipartite network, neighbors of a vertex 
are almost in the same community. As a result, for i, most of its neighbor should be in 
the same community with i except j (if j is a neighbor of i). As shown in Fig. 1.

2.2  Common Neighbor Index in Bipartite Network 

For  a  bipartite  network,  the  basic  community  detection  principle  is  “edges  inside 
communities are sparse, outside are dense”. The task is to maximize outA , written as 
max(

In a bipartite network, almost all adjacent vertices are in different communities. 
For a pair of vertices which are in the same community, the common neighbor should 
be in a different community, as shown in Fig. 2.

A VSP Model for Finding Community Structure   

In  this  section,  we  propose  our  VSP  model  to  find  community  structure.  In  [13], 
Newman et al. proved that a good division of a network in to communities “in which 
the number of edges inside groups is bigger than expected”. It can get a better result 
than the measures based on pure numbers of edges between communities. Similarly, a 
good  division  of  a  network  into  communities  should  be  one  which  the  number  of 
common neighbors within communities is bigger than expected. Let

vertex degree. It is known that common neighbor degree 

communities  instead  of  edges.  However,  we  can  also  find  that 

It  is  a  function  that  divides  the  network  into  groups,  with  larger  values  indicating 
stronger community structure. We build a random network in which vertices have same 
common  neighbor  degrees  as  the  vertices  in  the  complex  network,  and  assume  the 
expected  number  of  common  neighbors  as  the  number  in  the  random  network.  In 
section  2,  we  have  proved  that  common  neighbor  index  can  be  used  to  find 
outN   in  unipartite 
inN in bipartite network are both affected not only by edges but also by 
ik   and R

network. The probability of a random vertex to be a common neighbor of a particular 
ic . The probabilities 
vertex  i depends only on the expected common neighbor degree 
of a random vertex to be a common neighbor of two vertices are independent on each 
other. This implies that the expected number of common neighbors ijP between vertices 
i   and 
  of  separate  functions  of  the  two  common 
neighbor degrees, where the functions must be the same since 
ijP   is symmetric. Hence

We  use  the  VSP  matrix  instead  of  modularity  matrix  to  find  the  community 
structure. In the VSP model, the higher value of Q, the more similar vertices are in the 
same community. It can be applied to both unipartite networks and bipartite networks 
without knowing the exact type of network structure in advance. It is more flexible than 
the previous methods which deal with the grouping separately according to the type of 
the network structure.

Experimental Results 

In  this  section,  we  apply  the  VSP  model  to  a  unipartite  network  and  two  bipartite 
networks  with Pajek [34]. The unipartite  network  shows the dolphin social  network 
studied by Lusseau et al. [35]. The bipartite networks show the interactions of women 
in  the  American  Deep  South  at  various  social  events  [36]  and  Scotland  Corporate 
Interlock in early twentieth century [37]. 

Since  we  know  the  actual  communities  for  the  real  networks,  we  measure  the 
accuracy of the VSP model by directly comparing with the known communities. We 
take use of the normalized mutual information Inormn [38] for the comparison. When the 
found  communities  match  the  real  ones,  we  have  Inorm=1,  and  when  they  are 
independent of the real ones, we have Inorm=0. 

We compare the VSP model with the Modularity model in unipartite networks and 
bipartite  networks  by  three  properties:  the  edges  outside  communities;  Q  of  the 
Modularity model, where Q is the edges within communities minus expected number 
of such edges, written as Q-Modularity; and Inorm. 

4.1 

Finding Community Structure in Unipartite Network 

Q  in  Eq.  (6)  is  written  as  Q-VSP  in  this  section.  For  a  unipartite  network,  the  VSP 
model maximizes Q-VSP to find the community structure, while the Modularity model 
maximizes Q-Modularity. 

The dolphin social network is a classical unipartite social network. The vertices in 
this network represent 62 bottlenose dolphins living in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, 
with social ties between dolphin pairs established by direct observation over a period of 
several years. It is used a lot in community detection because the dolphin group split 
into two smaller subgroups following the departure of the population. Fig.3 shows the 
clustering results using the VSP model and the Modularity model respectively. 

464  K. Li and Y. Pang 

Two red vertices are grouped into the green community in the VSP model, while 

three red vertices are grouped into the green community in the Modularity model.   

In a unipartite network, edges inside the communities are dense, while outside are 
sparse.  Edges  outside  communities  should  be  small;  Q-Modularity  should  be  large; 
Inorm close to 1. Properties of the dolphin social network are shown in Table.1. It shows 
that two properties of VSP model are better than the Modularity model in this unipartite 
network. Q-Modularity of the VSP model is 0.381 which is approximately equal to the 
one of the Modularity model. The VSP model performs well in unipartite networks.

Finding Community Structure in Bipartite Network   

In a bipartite network, the VSP model also maximizes Q-VSP to find the community 
structure, the Modularity model minimizes Q-Modularity, which is contrary to in the 
unipartite network.

The  Southern  women  data  set  describes  the  grouping  of  18  women  in  14  social 
events constitute a bipartite network; and an edge exists between a woman and a social 
event if the woman was in attendance at the event. We use this network here to group it 
into two communities, shown in Fig.4. It shows that the VSP model groups the network 
accurately into two communities of “women” and “events”. 

Although using other finding community structure methods can also get the same 
result,  they  should  know  the  type  of  the  network  in  advance.  For  example,  in 
modularity,  it  gets  the  smallest  value  of  the  Modularity  model  but  not  the  biggest 
because the southern women network is a bipartite network. 

As  a  second  example  of  bipartite  network,  we  consider  a  data  set  on  Scotland 
Corporate  Interlock  in  early  twentieth  century.  The  data  set  is  characterized  by  108 
Scottish firms, detailing the corporate sector, capital, and board of directors for each 
firm. The data set includes only those board members who held multiple directorships, 
totaling 136 individuals. Unlike the Southern women network, the Scotland corporate 
interlock is not connected. We got the division of one community with 102 vertices and 
the other with 142 vertices when Q-VSP is the maximum value. 

We also compare three properties of the VSP model and the Modularity model. In a 
bipartite network, edges inside the communities are sparse, while outside are dense. 
Edges outside communities should be large; Q-Modularity should be small; Inorm close 
to 1. Properties of the Scotland corporate interlock are shown in Table 2.    All the three 
properties of the VSP model are better than the Modularity model. It proves that the 
VSP model also finds community structure accurately in bipartite networks.

In summary of section 4.1 and 4.2, the VSP model is a uniform model for finding 
community  structure  which  can  be  used  in  both  unipartite  networks  and  bipartite 
networks.  It  is  flexible  and  applicable  to  a  wide  range.  For  instance,  in  the  protein 
network  which  people  only  knows  its  tip  of  iceberg,  the  VSP  model  can  find  the 
community structure only with the topology of the network, even when we have no idea 
of the type of the network structure.

Conclusion 

In this paper, we define a VSP model for finding the community structure in complex 
networks. The VSP model is based on the vertex similarity using the common neighbor 
index. As common neighbor index is proved an effective measurement of the vertex 
similarity methods in complex network, it is applied to the VSP model to measure the 
vertex similarity. We prove that calculating the common neighbor inside communities 
of the  network is equivalent to calculation the least edges  outside communities in a 
unipartite  network  and  the  most  edges  outside  communities  in  a  bipartite  network.

Therefore, it is suitable for finding community structure in both unipartite and bipartite 
network.  Then  we  give  the  expectation  of  the  common  neighbor  between  any  two 
vertices and gave the VSP model. At last, we apply our model in the dolphin social 
network,  Southern  women  event  network  and  Scotland  corporate  interlock  network 
separately.  Results  showed  that  the  VSP  model  is  effective  for  finding  community 
structure without the need of the network structure type.
