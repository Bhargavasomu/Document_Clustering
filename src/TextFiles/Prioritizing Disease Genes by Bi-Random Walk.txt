Abstract. Random walk methods have been successfully applied to pri-
oritizing disease causal genes. In this paper, we propose a bi-random walk
algorithm (BiRW) based on a regularization framework for graph match-
ing to globally prioritize disease genes for all phenotypes simultaneously.
While previous methods perform random walk either on the protein-
protein interaction network or the complete phenome-genome heteroge-
nous network, BiRW performs random walk on the Kronecker product
graph between the protein-protein interaction network and the pheno-
type similarity network. Three variations of BiRW that perform balanced
or unbalanced bi-directional random walks are analyzed and compared
with other random walk methods. Experiments on analyzing the disease
phenotype-gene associations in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) demonstrate that BiRW eﬀectively improved disease gene pri-
oritization over existing methods by ranking more known associations in
the top 100 out of nearly 10,000 candidate genes.

Introduction

It is now well accepted that phenotypes are determined by genetic material under
environmental inﬂuences. To understand the relation between disease phenotypes
and genes, numerous genomic studies on large patient cohorts such as genome-
wide association studies [1][2] have been conducted to identify candidate disease
genes, and in the past decade, the knowledge of determined disease phenotype-
gene associations has been quickly accumulated in databases such as Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a database of human genes and genetic
disorders. Driven by the accumulated knowledge, random walk-based algorithms,
which take the advantage of the availability of large phenotypic and molecular
networks (Fig. 1), were proposed to utilize the disease modules and gene modules
in the networks to prioritize disease genes [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. The human disease
phenotype network [10] provides information on phenotype similarities computed

by text mining of the full text and clinical synopsis of the disease phenotypes
in OMIM [11]. Large molecular networks such as the human protein-protein
interaction network [12] [13] or functional linkage network [6] provide functional
relations among genes. Based on the observation that genes associated with the
same or related diseases tend to interact with each other in the gene network and
similar phenotypes tend to share the same disease genes, random walk provides
an eﬀective framework to explore the relations in the networks.

Gene Network

Phenotype Network

Motived by the graph matching problem, we
postulate that phenotype-gene associations can
be characterized by paired associations between
close by genes in the PPI network and close
by phenotypes in the phenotype similarity net-
work. Conﬁrmed by the high frequency of such
paired associations in OMIM, we propose a bi-
random walk algorithm (BiRW) to capture the
patterns in the networks to unveil the associa-
tion between the complete collection of disease
phenotypes and genes (phenome-genome asso-
ciation). The key assumption is that the global
structure of phenome-genome association can be
represented by paired associations, and thus, the
reconstruction of the complete phenome-genome
association can be achieved by maximizing the
number of such paired associations constrained
on the known associations. BiRW algorithm it-
eratively adds new associations into the network
by bi-random walk to evaluate the number of re-
covered paired associations with a decay factor penalizing the number of steps.
We investigated variants of BiRW by performing bi-random walk with balanced
or unbalanced steps in the the PPI network and the phenotype similarity net-
work, and evaluated the methods by experiments on OMIM data.

ing associations in disease

2 Methods

The disease phenotype-gene association network (or phenome-genome associa-
tion network) is a heterogeneous network composed of a phenotype network, a
gene network and the known phenotype-gene associations modeled by a bipartite
graph (Fig. 1). Let P(m×m), G(n×n) and A(m×n) be the adjacency matrix of the
phenotype network, the gene network and the association bipartite graph respec-
tively, where m is the number of phenotypes and n is the number of genes. The
objective is to predict the missing associations based on the heterogenous dis-
ease phenotype-gene association network by reconstructing an association matrix
R(m×n). The magnitude of each Rij provides the degree of association between
phenotype i and gene j. In the following, we ﬁrst introduce the loss function
for the learning problem and then the Bi-Random Walk algorithm (BiRW) that
minimizes the cost function for learning R.

2.1 Loss Function

Our assumption is that similar (or the same) phenotypes are more likely to share
the same causal gene or causal genes that interact with each other. More speciﬁ-
cally, we assume that the predicted paired associations should form the following
subgraph patterns: 1) the triangle with two phenotype nodes and one gene node
following the assumption “similar phenotypes may share the same causal gene”,
2) the triangle with one phenotype node and two gene nodes following the as-
sumption “causal genes of the same disease phenotype tend to interact”, and
3) the rectangle with two phenotype nodes and two gene nodes following the
assumption “genes associated with similar phenotypes tend to interact”. Based
on the assumptions, we deﬁne the following loss function over R,

L(R) = α

(cid:2)

u,v,i,j

(P ⊗ G)(i,u),(j,v)(Ri,u − Rj,v)2 + (1 − α)

(cid:2)

i,u

(Ri,u − Ai,u)2,

where P ⊗ G is the Kronecker product of P and G. Each P ⊗ G(i,u),(j,v) is
1 if Pi,j = 1 and Gu,v = 1, in other words phenotype i and j are neighbors
and gene u and v are also neighbors, and otherwise 0. In this loss function,
the ﬁrst term enforces a smoothness on R where phenotypes (i, j) and gene
(u, v) should form paired associations with phenotype i aligned with gene u and
phenotype j aligned with gene v when (i, j) are neighbors and (u, v) are also
neighbors. The second term uses prior knowledge A as a regularization term.
The trade-oﬀ between these two competing constraints is controlled by a positive
parameter α ∈ (0, 1]. Intuitively, the cost function in equation (1) evaluates that
by associating a phenotype and a gene in R, how many paired associations
are curated. The interpretation is closely related to global network alignment
algorithms that were applied to align protein-protein interaction networks across
species [14][15][16][17][18]. Since the ﬁrst term is actually a quadratic term of
the elements in R with Hessian D − (P ⊗ G), the Laplacian of graph P ⊗ G, the
loss function can be rewritten as the following quadratic function,

2.2 Bi-Random Walk

To minimize the loss function in equation (1), a straightforward method is to
apply random walk with restart on the Kronecker product matrix P ⊗ G. Since
P ⊗ G is (m × n) by (m × n), this approach does not scale to the large network.
We propose a bi-random walk strategy (BiRW), which performs random walk
on the phenotype network and the gene network simultaneously. BiRW aims to
maximize the number of paired associations by bi-random walk on both phe-
notype network and gene network to evaluate potential candidate associations

trices of the phenotype network and the gene network, respectively. A is the bipartite
graph of the known phenotype-gene association from OMIM. By iteratively extend-
ing the phenotype path and the gene path (achieved by multiplying P on the left
or G on the right in each step), the algorithm maximizes the number of paired as-
sociations (loops between phenotypes and genes) with the steps weighted by a decay

network, the gene network and the association network. In the ﬁrst step, each

(Fig. 2). By iteratively extending the phenotype path and the gene path (achieved
by multiplying P on the left and G on the right in each step), the algorithm eval-
uates each candidate association by the number of closed loops weighted by a
decay factor α ∈ (0, 1). The decay factor down-weights the importance of newly
formed loops as the number of random walk steps is getting larger. Here, the
matrix multiplications (P(m×m)·A(m×n)·G(n×n)) mimic jumps on the phenotype
element (P · A · G)(i,j) represents the number of paired associations obtained by
connecting a target phenotype i to a candidate gene j with phenotype or gene
paths length 1. If we ignore the decay factor for now, more generally, after t steps
of multiplication P . . . (P · (P · A · G) · G) . . . G = P t · A · Gt, the loop patterns
curated with up to t steps of random walks can be evaluated. To achieve the
best solution R(m×n), we formulated the problem as R = P · R · G, assuming
−→
P is column-normalized, G is row-normalized, and the elements in R add to 1.
P · R · G can be rewritten in a vector form P ⊗ G
R . Each bi-random walk is the
same as a random walk on the Markov matrix P ⊗ G. Thus, applying bi-random
walk is identical to using power method to ﬁnd the stationary distribution of
P ⊗ G. Note that the idea is also similar to a normalized and relaxed version of
regular graph-matching methods [17], which maximize the number of matched
edges in two graphs (the phenotype network and the gene network). In addition,
the known OMIM associations A normalized the same as R is introduced as
priori knowledge. The complete form of the model is as follows,

R = αP · R · G + (1 − α)A,

(2)

296

The decay factor α also plays the role to balance the objective of closed loops for
evaluating candidate associations and the consistence with the known associa-
tions in A. This equation can be solved by iteratively updating R by calculating
the right side of the equation (2) with the current R. The process also con-
verges to a unique solution [18]. Candidate associations can then be selected by
the magnitude of the scores in R. Essentially, this algorithm is mathematically
equivalent to the label propagation algorithm in [19], and it was shown that the
algorithm minimizes the cost function in equation (1).

2.3 Unbalanced Bi-Random Walk

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the steps to walk on the phenotype network and the
gene network explicitly summarize the closed loops in the previous step. The-
oretically, the random walk in the two directions will eventually converge to a
stationary distribution as the unique solution. However, since only the closed
loops of smaller path lengths are informative for predicting associations, exces-
sively counting loops obtained by a large number of random walk steps could
introduce false positives. Moreover, the phenotype similarity network and the
gene network contain diﬀerent topologies and structures, and thus, the optimal
number of random walk steps might be diﬀerent on the two networks. To ad-
dress the problem, we restrict the number of random walk steps on the two sides
by introducing two additional parameters l and r as the numbers of maximal
iterations in the following left/right random walk on the networks,

Left Walk: Rt = αP · Rt−1 + (1 − α)A
Right Walk: Rt = αRt−1 · G + (1 − α)A

(3)

Left Walk and Right Walk could be applied alternatively to introduce additional
steps in either phenotype network or gene network. The new formula does not
converge as equation 2 to a closed-form but it carries the same interpretation
that each left or right walk extends either the phenotype path length or the gene
path length. Empirically, l, r and α are the parameters tuned by cross-validation
on the training data.

3 Comparison of Random Walk Algorithms

In this section, we compare BiRW with the other random walk or label prop-
agation algorithms for disease gene prioritization [4][6][7][8][9]. For example,
PRINCE performs label propagation on the PPI network to prioritize disease
genes [8]. The initial probabilities on the gene nodes are normalized from the
causative genes of the nearest neighbors of the query phenotype p chosen by a
logistic function. The initial scores are propagated in the stochastic matrix nor-
malized from the PPI network. After convergence, the unique solution of label
propagation is used to rank the genes. RWRH [9] runs the same label propaga-
tion algorithm on the combined heterogeneous network of all the three networks
to rank genes for a query phenotype. MINProp [7] is based on a principled way to
integrate three networks in an optimization framework and performs iterative la-
bel propagation on each individual subnetwork. These disease gene prioritization

298

algorithms rank genes based on their predicted association against a particular
query phenotype while BiRW is a global approach which identiﬁes the missing
associations of all the phenotypes simultaneously. Thus, conceptually, BiRW is
a phenome-genome approach while the other algorithms are phenotype-wise ap-
proaches, none of which explores the relation between the predicted associations
across the phenotypes. To illustrate the diﬀerence between BiRW and the other
methods, we compared the initialization and the random walk steps of the al-
gorithms in Table 1. The ﬁrst diﬀerence is that these methods learn with the
structure of diﬀerent networks. Random Walk, Diﬀusion Kernel and PRINCE
perform random walk only on the PPI network combined with the direct neigh-
bors inferred from the phenotype network and the known associations. RWRH
and MINProp perform random walk on the complete heterogenous phenome-
genome association network. BiRW performs random walk on the Kronecker
product graph of the phenotype network and the gene network in the balanced
case or on the phenotype network and the gene network separately in the un-
balanced case.

BiRW

Another mathematical diﬀerence between BiRW and the other algorithms lies
in the formulation of using the known associations in A. PRINCE uses the known
associations to decide an initial set of genes that are associated with a query
phenotype. RWRH and MINProp directly use A as part of the large network for

Prioritizing Disease Genes by Bi-Random Walk

299

random walk. BiRW treats R as the target variable and the known association A
as a regularization of R, intuitively, because A is only partially known and most
of the zero entries of A are “unknown” instead of “no association”. Thus, using A
as a regularization instead of directly as part of the network for graph structure-
based learning is probably a more rigorous modeling because the incompleteness
of the bipartite network might mislead the random walk.

4 Experiments and Discussions

BiRW was compared to CIPHER [5], PRINCE [8] and RWRH [9], three of the
best performing algorithms for disease gene prioritization, by 100-fold cross-
validation and testing of an independent holdout set with OMIM data. We also
compared the three variants of BiRW, BiRW avg (default for BiRW), BiRW seq
and BiRW bl, with similar experiments.

4.1 Data Preparation

The disease phenotype network is an undirected graph with 5080 vertices repre-
senting OMIM disease phenotypes, and edges weighted in [0, 1]. The edge weights
measure the similarity between two phenotypes by their overlap in the text
and the clinical synopsis in OMIM records, calculated by text mining [10]. The
disease-gene associations are represented by an undirected bipartite graph with
edges connecting phenotype nodes with their causative gene nodes. Two versions
(May-2007 Version and May-2010 Version) of OMIM associations were used in
the experiments. May-2007 Version contains 1393 associations between 1126 dis-
ease phenotypes and 916 genes, and May-2010 Version contains 2469 associations
between 1786 disease phenotypes and 1636 genes. Human protein-protein inter-
action (PPI) network was obtained from HPRD [12]. The PPI network contains
34,364 curated binary interactions between 8919 genes.

4.2 Comparison with Other Methods

Since the disease gene prioritization algorithms rank genes based on their pre-
dicted association against a particular query phenotype, to make a reasonable
comparison with CIPHER [5], PRINCE [8] and RWRH [9], the three algorithms
were applied to predict the disease genes for each phenotype and the predictions
are compared with the results of BiRW phenotype-wise. In the experiment, a
disease phenotype was used as a query by an algorithm to rank the genes by
their association scores against the query phenotype. For PRINCE and BiRW,
the phenotype similarity network was transformed by a logistic function [8]. For
all the methods, a 100-fold cross-validation on the OMIM May-2007 Version was
performed for parameter tuning, and then the methods were applied to predict
the associations in an independent set of associations added into OMIM between
May-2007 and May-2010.

(B) Test Data

Fig. 3. Performance of predicting OMIM associations. The plots show the per-
centage of phenotypes, for which a given method achieved a ROC score exceeding a
threshold in cross-validation and testing.

There are 1126 disease phenotypes with at least one known causal gene in
OMIM version May-2007. In the 100-fold cross-validation, the 1126 disease phe-
notypes were randomly divided into 100 subsets. In each cross-validation trial,
the OMIM associations of the 1% disease phenotypes in a subset were removed,
and then used as queries to rank the candidate genes. The hyper-parameters α
for both PRINCE and BiRW were chosen from {0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9}, and l and r were
taken to be between 1 step to 5 steps. The three hyper-parameters of RWRH are
set to be the optimal parameters (0.5, 0.7, 0.5) suggested by the experiments in
[9]. The test set contains new associations of 518 phenotypes in OMIM May-2010
Version. ROC score (Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteris-
tic) was used as the global performance measure. The higher the target genes of
a query phenotype in the ranking, the better the performance. Speciﬁcally, for
each phenotype query, the target genes were labeled as positives and the other
genes were labeled as negatives. AUCs were computed by the positions of the
positives in the ranking list. We reported the AUC with up to 50, 100 and 300
false positives since the top part of AUC is more important.

The results produced by the best parameters in the cross-validation of each
method is reported in Fig. 3A (l = 4, r = 4 and α = 0.8 for BiRW and α = 0.1
for PRINCE). To make a comprehensive comparison, we plot the number of
phenotype queries with a AUC higher than a certain threshold in the plots.
The BiRW algorithm performed the best. Out of the 1126 phenotypes, BiRW
ranked around 55% in top 50 and 63% in top 500. PRINCE also gave decent
prediction performance although BiRW consistently outperformed PRINCE in
all the measures. RWRH, CIPHER DN (direct neighbor) and SP (shortest path)

produced inferior results in this experiment. The possible reason for the worse
results of CIPHER might be because the associations of the test phenotypes were
all removed (called ab initio experiment) and each cross-validation held out a
signiﬁcant number of known associations. Thus, no direct neighbors were avail-
able for the correlation calculation for many phenotype queries by CHPHER.
PRINCE, RWRH and BiRW worked much better than CIPHER SP and CI-
PHER DN because label propagation and bi-random walk both explore more
global information of the networks. We also measured the statistical signiﬁcance
of the diﬀerence in AUC50 and AUC100 by paired t-test. The p-values are re-
ported in Table 2. Clearly, BiRW performs signiﬁcantly better than all other
methods at the signiﬁcance level 0.05.

4.3 Comparison of BiRW Variants

To understand the eﬀect of combining left walk and right walk with diﬀerent
strategies, we compared BiRW avg, BiRW seq and BiRW bl with the same ex-
periments on OMIM data. The results are reported in Table 3. BiRW avg and
BiRW seq, which perform random walk with a limited number steps, performed
signiﬁcantly better than BiRW bl, which performs random walk till the conver-
gence to the stationary distribution. The observation partially agrees with the
results by [20] [21], which showed that genes within two-steps are more func-
tional cohesion in the PPI network. When the random-walk steps are above 2
in the gene network, results are very close to optimal as long as the number of
steps in the phenotype network is properly chosen. Since the results depends
on the random-walks in two networks and the decay factor, we found that it
is better to treat the steps as parameters as in BiRW avg and BiRW seq. It
is also interesting that BiRW avg performed constantly better than BiRW seq
although the diﬀerence is only marginal. We suspect that there might be a bias

in choosing the order of left walk and right walk when BiRW seq performs se-
quential random walks, and the bias might be data dependent. In BiRW avg,
there is no ambiguity in the order of the bi-random walk and thus, there might
be less variation expected in diﬀerent data.

5 Conclusion

In the paper, we introduced a bi-random walk algorithm (BiRW) for disease gene
prioritization. We analyzed the algorithm by comparison with other random
walk algorithms for disease gene prioritization with both algorithmic analysis
and empirical experiments. We concluded that BiRW is an eﬀective algorithm
for disease gene prioritization and the steps of random walks play a crucial role in
the performance of the algorithms. In future, we plan to explore other variations
of BiRW to more eﬀectively utilize the hidden information in the networks.
