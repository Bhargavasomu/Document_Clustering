Abstract. There are millions of accounts in Twitter. In this paper, we
categorize twitter accounts into two types, namely Personal Communi-
cation Account (PCA) and Public Dissemination Account (PDA). PCAs
are accounts operated by individuals and are used to express that in-
dividual’s thoughts and feelings. PDAs, on the other hand, refer to ac-
counts owned by non-individuals such as companies, governments, etc.
Generally, Tweets in PDA (i) disseminate a speciﬁc type of information
(e.g., job openings, shopping deals, car accidents) rather than sharing
an individual’s personal life; and (ii) may be produced by non-human
entities (e.g., bots). We aim to develop techniques for identifying PDAs
so as to (i) facilitate social scientists to reduce “noise” in their study of
human behaviors, and (ii) to index them for potential recommendation
to users looking for speciﬁc types of information. Through analysis, we
ﬁnd these two types of accounts follow diﬀerent temporal, spatial and
textual patterns. Accordingly we develop probabilistic models based on
these features to identify PDAs. We also conduct a series of experiments
to evaluate those algorithms for cleaning the Twitter data stream.

Introduction

As Twitter1 has grown, many diﬀerent kinds of user accounts have emerged.
At a general level, we roughly classify them into two categories: (i) Personal
Communication Account (PCA) and (ii) Public Dissemination Account (PDA).
PCAs are accounts that are usually operated by unique individuals and used for
interpersonal communication (e.g., to share personal experiences and opinions).
PDAs, in contrast, are typically linked to and operated by a company2, a web

site3 or a program4 and used to disseminate speciﬁc news and information (e.g.,
locations of car accidents, shopping deals, crimes).

Existence of PDA may cause problems when attempting to study human
behavior using Twitter data. Recently, a Twitter-based analysis in Science sug-
gested that changes in overall tweet sentiment over time (hours of the day)
may be interpreted as evidence of biologically-based diurnal cycles in the mood
patterns of humans [7]. However, an underlying assumption is that the tweets
were produced by human individuals as part of their natural daily lives. If the
data stream is a mixture of PCAs (humans) and PDAs (corporate/entity), the
conclusion may be unwarranted. To illustrate it, In Figure 1 we plot the time
evolution of average sentiment for 2,787 PCAs and 389 PDAs that were labelled
manually. As can be seen, the daily diurnal cycle, i.e., the mood increases in
the early morning and decrease later, is easily discernable in the overall data
(Figure 1(a)) as similar to the previously published analysis. However, contrary
to expectations, we ﬁnd that the cycles are much less prominent in the PCA (hu-
man individual) sub-sample (Figure 1(b)) than in the PDA (corporate/entity)
sub-sample (Figure 1(c)). The importance of separating the diﬀerent account
types for reaching accurate conclusions is clear.

Beyond potentially adding noise to researchers’ data streams, PDAs are po-
tentially very useful for various types of data consumers. For instance, an indi-
vidual looking for jobs may follow PDAs that publish job postings of a particular
type (e.g., web development) in a particular geographic area (e.g., New York).
Similarly, shoppers may follow PDAs that provide timely notiﬁcation of nearby
sale events and hot deals. In sum, as PDAs’ tweets are often focused on a very
speciﬁc topic and formatted in a uniform manner, they are relatively easy to
process and may thus provide rich content for individuals, researchers, and the
recommendation engines that support those populations.

The enormous size of the Twitter data stream makes it highly impractical to
manually check the account type. In this paper we develop and test a variety

Fig. 2. The framework for PDA detection

of techniques for automatic classiﬁcation of PDAs and PCAs using multiple
temporal, spatial, and textual features of accounts’ tweet publishing patterns.

Figure 2 gives an overview of the proposed framework for PDA detection. As
shown, tweets are continuously sent to the database. Once a new user arrives,
her proﬁle of raw data is checked and diﬀerent types of features are extracted.
Speciﬁcally as illustrated in Figure 2, there are temporal, spatial and textual
features (details are discussed in Section 2). With extracted features, a classiﬁ-
cation model is then employed to determine the account type. After a PDA is
detected, the system checks its posted tweets to model its topic as well as catego-
rizing its spatial characteristics. Finally, all extracted features and topic models
are also saved in the database. Twitter applications, e.g., user recommendation,
can then be built upon the knowledge mined in this framework.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the feature
extraction. Section 3 provides details of our models. Section 4 reports the eval-
uation of our model and shows some PDAs found using our model. Section 5
reviews relevant research and ﬁnally Section 6 concludes the whole paper.

2 Feature Extraction

In this section we discuss the extraction features used to identify PCAs and
PDAs. The work makes use of an archive of geo-tagged tweets published between
March 1, 2011 and January 18, 2012 [1]. During this time, 39,994,126 geo-tagged
tweets (with latitude and longitude attached) were posted by 1,506,937 users.
Ground truth classiﬁcation data were generated by randomly selecting 5,000
accounts that published at least 200 tweets and manually labeling them as PCA,
PDA, or unknown. Of the 5,000 randomly selected accounts 2,787 were PCAs,
389 PDAs, 0 spam accounts and 1,824 unknown accounts5. These data were then
used to extract and analyze the temporal, spatial and textual features of PCAs
and PDAs.

5 In our manual search of the data we did not identify any spam accounts. They
may not appear in the geo-tagged tweet stream, perhaps to maintain anonymity, or
because Twitter had already detected and blocked the tweet content (in which case
we would have labeled them as unknown).

2.1 Temporal Feature

PDAs are, by deﬁnition, regularly disseminating useful information. Often this
task is facilitated by use of automated computer programs that publish tweets
at speciﬁc times or at regular intervals [23]. In contrast, PCAs, being human,
may be less regimented in their communication of daily live events and feelings.
Figure 3(a) and 3(b) show the timing (minutes by seconds) of tweets published
by two Twitter accounts. The speciﬁc times at which tweets were sent by the
user depicted in the Figure 3(a) are spread relatively uniformly across the space.
That is, the user does not appear to have a preference for speciﬁc minute-second
combinations. In contrast, the user depicted in the right panel tweets at very
speciﬁc times. While this program/bot- controlled PDA is not able to get the
tweet out at exactly the same second each hour, the temporal distribution is
clearly non-uniform.

Fig. 3. Time distribution of tweets published by PCA and PDA

Consider the two-dimensional time space shown in Figure 3(a) and 3(b) where
the x-axis is the exact minute (0-59) within the hour that the tweet was pub-
lished, and the y-axis is the exact second (0-59) of that minute. Tweets’ time-
stamp information can be used to locate each tweet as a point in this space.
For each account, we count the number of tweets within each section of the
grid and compute the sum of the diﬀerence between the observed frequency and
the expected uniform frequency to obtain a temporal feature. Formally, let g
denote the total number of grids and each time stamp can be converted to a
g
i=1 xi = 1. This
vector indicates which grid the time stamp belongs to. Suppose there are N
tweets and the expected number of tweets falling in each grid should be N/g for
a uniform distribution. We deﬁne a time uniformity metric du to measure the
diﬀerence between the observed time distribution and a uniform one.

a log-Gaussian distribution centered around 6, while the PDAs du are skewed
from 6 upwards.

2.2 Spatial Feature

PCA’s and PDA’s tweets may also exhibit diﬀerent spatial distributions. As
people go about their daily lives, they often tend to move around within a limited
area, periodically switch between previously visited locations (e.g., home and
work), and are constrained by the physical parameters bounding how fast they
can travel between locations [8,20,5,4]. In contrast, PDAs, by their very nature,
are not constrained. Twitter APIs can be used to tweet from multiple locations
simultaneously and/or purposively designate the geo-locations that should be
attached to each tweet. Figure 4(a) and 4(b) show the footprints of geo-located
tweets respectively published by a PCA and a PDA. It can be seen that the PCA
tweets from a small area (303.0233 km2) in New York, while the PDA tweets
from all across the United States (about 9.6302 × 106 km2). The narrow and
sharp peak in Figure 4(c) indicates a PCA visits the same locations repeatedly.
In contrast, the density distribution of a PDA in Figure 4(d) is much ﬂatter,
indicating that this account rarely tweets from the same locations.

represents the smoothed frequency of visits.

We deﬁne two metrics, namely Mobility Area (MA) and Unit Mobility Entropy
(UME) to capture the spatial features. MA is a measure of an account’s mobility

range. For a set of points in geographic space (cid:2)p1,··· , pn(cid:3), where pi = (xi, yi)
consists of a longitude xi and a latitude yi, we can ﬁnd a minimum bounding
box (cid:2)pmin = (xmin, ymin), pmax = (xmax, ymax)(cid:3) that covers all points. MA is

deﬁned as the surface area of the bounding box in the earth.

UME measures the diversity of spatial locations visited during a speciﬁc unit
of time. A smaller value indicates a higher probability of revisiting the same

location. Formally, given a unique set of locations (cid:2)p1,··· , pn(cid:3) that appear in
one’s tweets and a minimum bounding box (pmin, pmax) that covers these points,
the UME is deﬁned in Equation (3).

where fi represents the frequency of tweets that contains the geographical point
pi and ΔT is the time interval between the earliest tweet and the most recent
one.

Furthermore, we can calculate the “moving” speed of the account by checking
the time stamp and geo-coding of its successive tweets. For some PDAs, where
account holders may publish tweets from multiple, distant locations within a
short interval, moving speed may be quite large. In contrast, PCAs are bounded
by the physical constraints on human mobility.

2.3 Textual Feature

Content of PDA’s tweets may also diﬀer from that of PCA’s. Given that PDAs’
main objective is to disseminate a speciﬁc kind of information, they may reuse
particular words. In contrast, PCAs tend to share a more diverse set of infor-
mation and thus use a wider variety of words. Here we deﬁne a metric tweet
coverage of a word as the proportion of tweets that contain the word.

We focus on two textual features: word-usage size and tweet coverage. The
former measures the number of unique words appearing in an account’s tweets.
Since tweets of PDA aim to propagate one particular type of information, the
word set is constrained towards a speciﬁc topic. In this case, the size of word set
is relatively small compared to that of PCAs.

Formally, let W = (cid:2)w1,··· , wn(cid:3) denote the global word set and f u

i denote the
number of user u’s tweets that contain the word wi. For N posted tweets of an
account, the word-usage size of the user wsu is deﬁned in Equation (4).

wsu =

n(cid:3)

i=1

1f u

i (cid:3)=0

(4)

Tweet coverage is the probability of a single word appearing in the tweet.
Given a user u’s N tweets, the tweet coverage for a word wi can be computed by
f u
i

N . Particularly, we are focused on the mean of top-k (k ≤ n) words (referred to

as top-k mean) and tweet-coverage variance of all words (referred to as global
variance) for that user. Suppose we sort the words in a non-ascending order
based on their tweet frequency, i.e., ∀i, j ∈ [1, wsu], we have f u
⇔ i ≥ j.
The top-k mean μu and global variance σ2
u of tweet coverage for the user account

Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show the words’ tweet coverage of 1,000 randomly sam-
pled tweets for a PCA and a PDA. It can be easily seen that the tweet coverage
for a PCA is quite low and the maximal one is about 0.04, i.e., the most frequent
word appears in 4% of her published tweets. In contrast, the PDA (Figure 5(b))
uses some words in almost every tweet. In this example the PDA is a corporate
account that tweets jobs for mobile phone retail in diﬀerent US cities. The words
with 100% tweet coverage are job, mobile and retail.

Fig. 5. Tweet coverage and sentiment distribution for PCA and PDA

Moreover, since PCA’s tweets are a reﬂection of their daily life, the sentiment
of the tweets are more likely to ﬂuctuate than that of PDAs. By adopting the
lexicon for word-sentiment in existing works [16,17], we estimate a sentiment
score for each tweet. Figure 5(c) and 5(d) show the standard deviation of PCA’s
and PDA’s sentiment in Tweets covering a 24 hour time period. It can be seen
that on average the PDA’s tweets display less ﬂuctuation of sentiment than the
PCA’s. Therefore, the deviation of sentiment is also extracted as a feature.

3 Detection Model

In this section we describe details of our detection model, including model de-
velopment, parameter learning and detection function. Speciﬁcally to ﬁt the
temporal, spatial and textual features of PCAs, we propose a generative model
that is adapted for stream training data. Classiﬁcation of PDAs is solved by
detecting the outliers of the ﬁtted model.

3.1 Model Development

Without loss of generality, let D = (cid:2)x1,··· , xn(cid:3) denote the values of extracted
features. Here each element xi represents the feature value of an account. The
semantics depends on the feature types. For instance, xi could indicate the
log-value of du (see Equation (1) for deﬁnition) for a temporal feature, or
ma (Equation (2)) for a spatial feature, or ws (Equation (4)) for a textual
feature. Based on maximum-likelihood theory, to learn the model parameter
μ, λ, we need to maximize the probability P r(μ, λ|D). Using Bayesian inference,
P r(μ, λ|D) = P r(D|μ, λ)P r(μ, λ), where the P r(μ, λ) is the prior distribution.

Under the assumption that the data D is generated by some Gaussian distri-

Furthermore, since P r(μ, λ) = P r(μ|λ)P r(λ), we use a Gaussian and Gamma
distribution as the conjugate prior distribution P r(μ|λ) and P r(λ), as shown in
Equation (7) and (8).

Therefore, the prior distribution is represented by a product of a Gaussian and
a Gamma distribution. Conversion to match the format of posterior distribution

3.2 Model Training for Stream Data

In previous subsection we uniﬁed the prior and posterior distribution in Equation
(10). Now we can deﬁne the objective function and learn the parameters by
maximizing it.
Let θ = (cid:2)α, β, γ(cid:3) denote the parameters for prior distribution and we deﬁne
the objective function as the log of the probability P r(μ, λ|D), i.e., L(μ, λ) =

Separating PCA and PDA in Twitter

171

log P r(μ, λ|D, θ). By setting partial diﬀerential ∂L
∂λ to 0, we can estimate
the value for model parameters. Without loss of generality, suppose there are
two sets of training samples coming in a stream, where X = (cid:2)x1,··· , xn1(cid:3) arrives
ﬁrst and it is followed by Y = (cid:2)y1,··· , yn2(cid:3). Also, let (μx, λx) denote the model

∂μ and ∂L

parameters learned purely based on X, the sequential learning process is then
illustrated in Equation (11) and (12).

From the Equation (11) and Equation (12) we can see good characteristics
of the model. Suppose the model has been trained based on the dataset X and
a new dataset Y comes. With such sequential learning equations, instead of re-
training on the whole dataset, we can simply update the model parameters with
the new dataset.

3.3 Detection Function

Given the extracted features of a target account, we use the trained model to
compute the probability that this account is generated by the model. The higher
the value is, the more likely the account is a PCA.

Formally, suppose there is an unknown account with features u0 = (cid:2)f1,··· , f6(cid:3).
The parameters of corresponding Gaussian distribution are denoted by M =
),···(cid:3). The ranking score Su0 is a vector of log-likelihood that the
(cid:2)(··· , (μi, λ

i

given feature vector is generated by the model M .

Su0 = Rank(u0, M ) = (cid:2)··· , log N (fi; μi, λ

where C is a constant that is independent of the target account u0 and model
parameters.

The ﬁnal detection is a voting process. Given the threshold vector δ, the
detection function will judge whether the given account is PDA in each feature
dimension. If the number of votes exceeds a threshold vδ, the function will output
1, indicating the account is classiﬁed as PDA.

3.4 Other Classiﬁers

Besides the proposed probabilistic model, we also examine the utility of other
widely used classiﬁers in this framework. Particularly we examine Support Vector

172

P. Yin et al.

Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.
The latter two are both implemented by Weka [10].

The SVM we adopt is developed by LIBSVM [2]. Since the number of PDA
is far smaller than that of PCA, we develop three variant SVM for imbalanced
classiﬁcation problem. The ﬁrst one over-samples minor class and is denoted as
DUP-SVM. The second one under-samples the major class and is referred to as
RED-SVM. Finally we increase the misclassiﬁcation cost of the minority class
to 100 times than that of the majority class and is referred to as Biased-SVM.

4 Evaluation

This section we evaluate the classiﬁers in terms of both eﬀectiveness measured
by Fβ and eﬃciency measured by training time. All evaluation are based on
four-fold cross-validation and average performance is reported. Then we run our
generative model on the unlabeled data to mine new PDAs. The data set we use
for evaluation is a collection of manually labeled accounts, 389 PDAs and 2,787
PCAs. For Fβ, we set β = 0.25 because precision is relatively more important
than recall in our case.

4.1 Experiments

Figure 6(a) shows the impact of threshold on the performance of the generative
model. Generally, small threshold can achieve high accuracy PDA detection but
may miss many PDAs. On the other hand, big threshold may reduce missing
rate but lead to false identiﬁcation. Figure 6(b) shows the general comparison
of diﬀerent methods on PDA/PCA classiﬁcation. Particularly we choose the
feature threshold δ and vote threshold vδ with regarding to maximize PDA’s
and PCA’s F-measure, which are respectively denoted as M df and M cf . The
tuning process is not shown in this paper due to the page limit. We can see that
our probabilistic model is either better than or close to the best performance of
other classiﬁers. We also use synthetic data to evaluate the eﬃciency. Figure 6(c)
shows the result and it can be seen that the time cost of training our model
increases slowest as the data set grows. Note that the time cost for KNN mainly
comes from classiﬁcation where all training data is scanned for each classiﬁcation
task. The experiment shows it takes KNN 1.0334 seconds to classify one account
when the training data set is 100,000. For SVM, the time cost is 401.785 seconds
for 20,000 training samples in our experiment.

4.2 Exploration

In this section we run our trained model on the unlabeled data to explore new
possible PDAs. By the time the paper is written, we have detected 13,871 PDAs.
Table 1 shows some of the detected PDAs. In the table, some twitter account
has such symbols as XXX and YYY. They mean there is a bunch of twitter
accounts with similar naming rules, where XXX means the type of jobs while
YYY stands for a particular area name, e.g., tmj tx intern is a PDA that tweets
internship in Texas, sp arizona tweets about deals and coupons in Arizona.

5 Related Work

Two areas are related, (i) human mobility modeling, and (ii) spam detection.

As more and more people use geo-enabled smart phones to share their loca-
tions via social media, there is a large number of studies on modeling individ-
ual’s mobility pattern. Generally there are two categories: (i) predicting user’s
location [3,11,12], and (ii) modeling continuous moving behavior [4,5,14]. These
works and our work are of mutual beneﬁt to each other. On one hand, observa-
tions of these works serve as a guideline for us to design spatial features for our
detection model. On the other hand, these existing works do not diﬀerentiate
common user accounts and non-human accounts. Our work can facilitate them
to reduce “noise” in the data.

Many works studied the methods to battle with spammer in Twitter. In
[19,18,6,22,15,21], following/followee structure was exploited.Also, spammers are
usually controlled by some program and thus the times tamp of their published

174

P. Yin et al.

tweets can be used for detection [9,23,6,13]. Since one of the spammer’s moti-
vations is to propagate some information, content-based features (e.g., ratio of
URLs, number of hash tags, etc) were also used in some works [18,9,9,13].

These spammer-detection works are complementary to ours. Firstly, some
features (e.g., minute-second distribution in [23]) can be used to detect PDA.
Also, some spammers may disguise themselves as a PDA (e.g., adding random
geo-tag in their tweets) and techniques of these works can be of great help to
our framework to reﬁne the detection result.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

The Twitter data stream is an immensely rich data resource to which many
diﬀerent types of entities are contributing. As such, eﬀective use may require
separation of tweets by account type. We identiﬁed types of accounts that may
be especially interesting to researchers and information consumers, with speciﬁc
concentration on Public Dissemination Account (PDA) and Personal Communi-
cation Account (PCA). To separate PDAs from millions of PCAs in Twitter, we
deﬁned and extracted temporal, spatial and textual features of each account’s
tweets and compared our proposed probabilistic model to other conventional
classiﬁers including SVM, KNN, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The experiment
showed while the probabilistic model displays better or similar performance with
these classiﬁers, it shows higher eﬃciency in training and is more adapted for
stream data.

In future work we plan to strengthen our current system so that it can auto-
matically build a detailed and dynamic taxonomy of PDAs, thus turning gold
specks into nuggets that are more easily mined out of the Twitter stream.
