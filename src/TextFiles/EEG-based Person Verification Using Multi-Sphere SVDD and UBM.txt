Abstract. The use of brain-wave patterns extracted from electroen-
cephalography (EEG) brain signals for person veriﬁcation has been in-
vestigated recently. The challenge is that the EEG signals are noisy due
to low conductivity of the human skull and the EEG data have unknown
distribution. We propose a multi-sphere support vector data descrip-
tion (MSSVDD) method to reduce noise and to provide a mixture of
hyperspheres that can describe the EEG data distribution. We also pro-
pose a MSSVDD universal background model (UBM) to model impos-
tors in person veriﬁcation. Experimental results show that our proposed
methods achieved lower veriﬁcation error rates than other veriﬁcation
methods.

Introduction

The use of brain-wave patterns for person veriﬁcation has been investigated at
IDIAP in Switzerland [1]. It has been shown that the brain-wave pattern of every
individual is unique and that the electroencephalography (EEG) brain signal can
be used for person identiﬁcation [2]. Traditional biometrics such as ﬁngerprint,
voice, and retina can be damaged or missing for some people, however EEG
biometric exists in every person. EEG has advantageous such as unobtrusive,
requiring living person recording, spontaneous signal, individual uniqueness due
to diﬀerent brain conﬁgurations [3].

Person veriﬁcation is diﬀerent from person identiﬁcation. Person identiﬁcation
is to match the user biometric data against all the records in a database, while
person veriﬁcation is to accept or to reject a user claimed identity providing his
biometric data. EEG-based biometry is an emerging research topic that can open
new research directions and applications. Most EEG-based biometry work was
focusing mainly on person identiﬁcation, for example [4] and very little work has
been done on person veriﬁcation [1]. In [5], Manhattan distances on autoregressive
(AR) coeﬃcients with PCA were used to compute thresholds for determining test
patterns were clients or impostors, the person veriﬁcation task from 5 subjects
were done in 2 stages. In [6], Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to

determine dominating brain regions to extract AR features, then a Naive Bayes
probabilistic model is employed for person authentication of 7 subjects with Half
Total Error Rate (HTER) of 2.2%. In [1], Gaussian mixture models has been ap-
plied for person veriﬁcation task on EEG signal from 9 subjects. Half total error
rate of 6.6 % was achieved for imagination left task. Those results were satisfactory
but the numbers of subjects were very small.

Most features in BCI research have high dimensionality due to the number
of channels. In addition, the training sets are usually small since the training
process is time consuming and demanding [7]. As a result, models based on
density estimation do not have enough data for training. Usually, maximum a
posteriori adaptation is used to overcome this problem as seen in [1]. On the
other hand, models based on kernel aim at determining the boundaries of the
data instead of probability density, hence they do not require a lot of data
for training. In support vector data description (SVDD), a spherically shaped
boundary around a normal data set is used to separate this set from abnormal
data. The volume of this data description is minimized to reduce the chance of
accepting abnormal data. In [8], SVDD was used to model 70 individuals using
energy features and attained 0.9913 area under curve (AUC). However SVDD
does not guarantee that the single spherically shaped boundary can best describe
the EEG data due to complex data distributions and much noise and outliers.
A better description is the use of multiple spheres, however there is currently no
investigation available for EEG-based person veriﬁcation.

In speaker veriﬁcation, the task can be stated as a hypothesis testing be-
tween the two hypotheses: the input utterance is from the hypothesis speaker,
client, (H0) or not from the hypothesis speaker, impostors, (H1). The diﬃculties
are usually in modelling the hypothesis H1 since it should represent all possi-
ble alternatives speakers. There are two approaches to model the alternatives
speakers [9]. The ﬁrst approach uses a set of other speaker models to cover the
space of the alter native hypothesis, this is called likelihood ratio sets, cohorts
or background speakers. The selection, size and combination of the background
speakers have been the subject of much research [9]. The second approach pools
speech from several speakers and train a single model, this is called the world
model or universal background model (UBM). This approach has become the
predominate and has been focused on selection and composition of the speakers
[9]. The advantage of this approach is that a single background model can be
trained once and shared for all hypothesis testing of individual speakers.

GMM UBM has been the state-of-the-art high performance probabilistic model
for representing speaker model and alternative speaker models because of its
capability to approximate arbitrary densities [10]. Recently, Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) has been used for speaker veriﬁcation. Because SVM draws an op-
timal hyper-plane to separate two classes, its application to speaker veriﬁcation
is to separate the client from impostors. The score of a vector is its the distance
to the hyperplane and the threshold can be changed by adding some amount to
the decision value causing the hyperplane moves nearer or further the class H0.
In [11] SVM was combined with GMM for speaker veriﬁcation by stacking the

EEG-Based Person Veriﬁcation Using Multi-Sphere SVDD and UBM

291

means of the adapted mixture components into a GMM super-vectors. Then a
linear kernel is derived based on an approximation to KL divergence between
two GMM models. In [12] and [8] the authors use SVDD for speaker veriﬁcation
task the distance to the sphere centers are used as scores, the former author con-
vert score to probability and the later author use percentage of rejection data
as threshold.

In this paper, we propose a multi-sphere SVDD (MSSVDD) person veriﬁcation
in which an optimisation problem and an iterative algorithm are proposed to
determine model parameters for MSSVDD to provide a better data description
to EEG data for a person. An SVM UBM model is proposed to represent the
person and background models as a set of sphere distributions, each sphere can
represent some characteristics of a person with well-trained decision boundaries.
Hence the collection of spheres can hopefully represent the varieties of feature
space.

Experimental results on 4 large data sets show that the proposed multi-sphere
SVDD can perform as the GMM UBM and the SVM UBM out perform GMM
UBM.

2 Multi-Sphere SVDD

2.1 Problem Formulation

Consider a set of m hyperspheres Sj(cj, Rj)with center cj and radius Rj, j =
1, . . . , m. This hypershere set is a good data description of the normal data set

X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} if each of the hyperspheres describes a distribution in this

data set and the sum of all radii

j should be minimised.

(cid:2)m

j=1 R2

Let matrix U = [uij]n×m, i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m where uij is the hard
membership representing the belonging of data point xi to hypersphere Sj, uij =
0 if xi is not in Sj and uij = 1 if xi is in Sj. The optimisation problem of multi-
sphere SVDD can be formulated as follows

where R = [Rj]j=1,...,m is vector of radii, C is a constant, ξ = [ξi]i=1,...,n is
vector of slack variables, φ(.) is the nonlinear function related to the symmetric,
positive deﬁnite kernel function K(x1, x2) = φ(x1)T φ(x2), and c = [cj]j=1,...,m
is vector of centres.

Minimising the function in (1) over variables R, c and ξ subject to (2) will
determine radii and centres of hyperspheres and slack variables if the matrix U

292

is given. On the other hand, the matrix U will be determined if radii and centres
of hyperspheres are given. Therefore an iterative algorithm will be applied to
ﬁnd the complete solution. The algorithm consists of two alternative steps: 1)
Calculate radii and centres of hyperspheres and slack variables, and 2) Calculate
membership U .

For classifying a data point x, the following decision function is used

2.2 Calculating Radii, Centres and Slack Variables

The Lagrange function for the optimisation problem in (1) subject to (2) is as
follows

where s(i) is index of the hypersphere to which data point xi belongs and satisﬁes

uis(i) = 1 and uij = 0 ∀j (cid:5)= s(i).

Setting derivatives of L(R, c, ξ, α, β)with respect to primal variables to 0, we

obtain m individual optimisation problems as follows

subject to

(cid:4)

αi = 1

and 0 ≤ αi ≤ C j = 1, . . . , m

(6)

After solving all of these individual optimization problems, we can calculate the
updating radii R = [Rj] and centres c = [cj], j = 1, . . . , m using the equations
in SVDD.

2.3 Calculating Membership U

We use radii and centres of hyperspheres to update the membership matrix U .
The following algorithm is proposed:

For i = 1 to n do

If xi is misclassiﬁed then

Let j0 = arg minj

End if
Else

Denote J = {j : xi ∈ S(cj, Rj)}
(cid:6)||φ(xi) − cj||2
Let j0 = arg minj∈J
Set uij0 = 1 and uij = 0 if j (cid:5)= j0

(cid:7)

End Else

End For

2.4 Iterative Learning Process

The proposed iterative learning process for multi-sphere SVDD will run two al-
ternative steps until a convergence is reached as follows

Initialise U by clustering the normal data set in the input space
Repeat the following

Calculate R, c and ξ using U
Update U using R and c

Until a convergence is reached.

3 MSSVDD UBM

The MSSVDD UBM models the background space by using multi-hypersphere
distribution approach. The set of K background people is trained using multi-
sphere SVDDs, each person is represented by n spheres resulting nK spheres
in total. Then this single background model will be shared for all hypothesis
testing of individuals. When testing hypothesis for a person, his/her model will
be removed from the background model.

Below are widely used normalisation methods in person veriﬁcation [13]:

L0(x) = log P (x|λ0)
P (x|λ0)
P (x|λ)

L1(x) =

L1(x) = log P (x|λ0) − log P (x|λ)

L2(x) = log P (x|λ0) − max
λ(cid:4)=λ0

log P (x|λ)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

The simplest method of scoring is to use the absolute likelihood score or in its
log domain (7). The score (8) and its log domain (9) uses normalisation, the
term log P (X|λ) is called the normalisation term and requires calculation of all
impostors likelihood functions. An approximation of this method is to use only
the closest impostor model for calculating the normalisation term (10)

Let x be a feature vector, S = S(c, R) be a hyper-sphere, we can consider the

probability of x belongs to the sphere S as

294

P. Nguyen et al.

P (x|λS) = e

−(cid:5)x−c(cid:5)

Then the above scores for SVM will become

L0(x) = log P (x|λS) = − (cid:7)x − cS(cid:7)
−(cid:5)x−cS(cid:5)
e
T(cid:4)=S e−(cid:5)x−cT (cid:5)
(cid:4)
L1(x) = log P (x|λS) − log P (x|λ) = − (cid:7)x − cS(cid:7) − log
L2(x) = log P (x|λS) − max
λ(cid:4)=λS

T(cid:4)=S
log P (x|λ) = − (cid:7)x − cS(cid:7) + max
T(cid:4)=S

P (x|λS)
P (x|λ)

L1(x) =

−(cid:5)x−cT (cid:5)

e
(cid:7)x − cT(cid:7)

(cid:2)

=

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

The above scores for SVM have simple interpretations. The score (11) with a
radius threshold RS checks whether x is inside or outside sphere S. The score
(12), (13) and (14) check whether x is nearer to the sphere S than other sphere
T .
P (x|λS) = e

In this paper, we deﬁne the probability of x belonging to the sphere S as

−(cid:5)x−c(cid:5)−R to incorporate the sphere size.

4 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

Since the distribution of feature vectors in X is unknown, it is approximately
modelled by a mixture of Gaussian densities, which is a weighted sum of K
component densities, given by the equation

P (X|λ) =

P (xt|λ) =

T(cid:8)

t=1

T(cid:8)

K(cid:4)

t=1

i=1

wiN (xt, μi, Σi)

(15)

where λ denotes a prototype consisting of a set of model parameters λ =
{wi, μi, Σi} , wi
, i = 1, . . . , K, are the mixture weights and N (xt, μi, Σi)
,i = 1, . . . , K, are the d-variate Gaussian component densities with mean vectors
μi and covariance matrices Σi.

5 GMM-UBM

The background model for GMM-UBM is trained in a similar way to MSSVDD-
UBM. The set of K background people is trained using GMMs, each person is
represented by a mixture of n Gaussian resulting nK Gaussian in total. Then this
single background model will be shared for all hypothesis testing of individuals.
When testing hypothesis for a person, his/her model will be removed from the
background model. The score (14) will be used for testing.

6 Hypothesis Testing

The veriﬁcation task can be stated as a hypothesis testing between the two
hypotheses: the input is from the hypothesis person, (H0) or not from the hy-
pothesis person (H1) [13].

Let λ0 be the claimed person model and λ be a model representing all other
possible people, i.e. impostors. For a given input X and a claimed identity, the
choice is between the hypothesis H0: X is from the claimed person λ0, and the
alternative hypothesis H1: X is from the impostors λ. A claimed person’s score
L(X) is computed to reject or accept the person claim satisfying the following
rules

(cid:9)

L(X)

> θLaccept
(cid:2) θLreject

(16)

where θL are the decision thresholds.

7 Experiments

7.1 Datasets

The Australian EEG Database used in this research consists of EEG recordings
of 40 patients. This database consists of EEG records recorded at the John
Hunter Hospital [14], near University of Newcastle, over an 11-year period. The
recordings were made by 23 electrodes placed on the scalp sampled at 167 Hz
for about 20 minutes.

The EEG motor movement/imagery (EEGMMIDB) dataset contain record-
ings of 109 subjects performed diﬀerent motor/imagery tasks1 [15]. Each subject
performed 14 experimental runs in one or three minutes. The tasks include open-
ing and closing ﬁsts or imagine opening and closing ﬁsts. The recordings used
64 electrodes 10-10 system.

The Alcoholism datasets come from a study to examine EEG correlates of
genetic predisposition to alcoholism. The datasets contain EEG recordings of
control and alcoholic subjects. Each subject was exposed to either a single stim-
ulus (S1) or two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from
the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown,
they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to
S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 diﬀered from S2. The 64 electrodes
placed on the scalp sampled at 256 Hz for 1 second. The Alcoholism large dataset
contains training and test data for 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects. The Al-
coholism full dataset contains 120 trials for 122 subjects. The summary of those
datasets is listed in Table 1

7.2 Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

EEG signals were ﬁrst divided into 15-millisecond segments. The Alcoholism
large and full datasets are downsampled to 128 Hz. Then the raw EEG signals
were spatially ﬁltered using Surface Laplacian (SL) with spline interpolation
constant of 4. This ﬁlter can represent better the cortical activity of local sources
below the electrodes [1]. Then the power spectral density (PSD) in the band 8-
30 Hz was estimated. The Welch’s averaged modiﬁed periodogram method was
used for spectral estimation. Hamming window was set to 1 second and 50%
overlap. 12 power components in the frequency band 8-30 Hz were extracted.

Besides PSD features, autoregressive (AR) model parameters were extracted.
In AR model, each sample is considered linearly related with a number of its
previous samples. The AR model has the advantage of low complexity and has
been used for person identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation [16] [17] [5]. Burg’s lattice-
based method was used with the AR model order 21, as a previous study [17]
suggested when there were many subjects and epochs.

The electrodes C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4 and Pz were selected to extract PSD
and AR features that result in 6*(12+21)=198 features. Those electrodes are
available in both datasets and were used in previous study [1] based on expert
knowledge.

7.3 Experimental Results

All experiments were conducted using 3-fold cross validation training and the
best parameters found were used to train models on the whole training set and
test on a separate test set. Table 2 shows the identiﬁcation rate of GMM training.
The best parameter number of Gaussian is 128 for Australian EEG dataset and
4 for EEGMMIDB dataset.

For MSSVDD training the RBF kernel function K(x, x

was
used. The parameter for MSSVDD training is γ and ν. The parameter γ was
searched in {2k : k = 2l + 1, l = −8,−7, . . . , 2}. The parameter ν is considered
proportional to the rejection percentage of the positive data when training the
smallest hypersphere enclosing the positive data. The best parameters found
for the ﬁrst two datasets are γ = 0.031 and ν = 0.031 with EER=0.221 and
the latter two datasets are γ = 0.125, ν = 0.125 with EER=0.25 and 0.35
respectively.

8 Conclusion

We have presented a Multi-Sphere Support Vector Data Description approach to
solving person veriﬁcation problem. Experiments on the Australian EEG, EEG
motor movement/imagery and Alcoholism datasets show a lower veriﬁcation
error rates comparing with SVDD and Gaussian mixture model-based universal
background model (GMM-UBM).
