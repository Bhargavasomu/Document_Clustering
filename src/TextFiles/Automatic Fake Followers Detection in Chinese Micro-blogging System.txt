Abstract. Micro-blogging, which has greatly inﬂuenced people’s life, is expe-
riencing fantastic success in the worldwide. However, during its rapid develop-
ment, it has encountered the problem of content pollution. Various pollution in the
micro-blogging platforms has hurt the credibility of micro-blogging and caused
signiﬁcantly negative effect. In this paper, we mainly focus on detecting fake fol-
lowers which may lead to a problematic situation on social media networks. By
extracting major features of fake followers in Sina Weibo, we propose a binary
classiﬁer to distinguish fake followers from the legitimate users. The experiments
show that all the proposed features are important and our method greatly out-
performs to detect fake followers. We also present an elaborate analysis on the
phenomenon of fake followers, infer the supported algorithms and principles be-
hind them, and ﬁnally provide several suggestions for micro-blogging systems
and ordinary users to deal with the fake followers.

Keywords: Micro-blogging, Fake followers, Classiﬁcation, Feature extraction.

1 Introduction

Due to its simplicity and rapid velocity, micro-blogging is experiencing tremendous
success. However, the micro-blogging services have also encountered several serious
troubles during their booming development, one of which is the fake followers prob-
lem. The phenomenon of fake followers emerges soon after the birth of micro-blogging
systems and now has ﬂooded in the mainstream micro-blogging services such as Twit-
ter[twitter.com] and Sina Weibo[weibo.com]. According to Yahoo reports1, a consider-
able part of the followers of celebrities on Twitter are fake, and the proportion may be
as high as over 50%. Despite both Twitter and Sina Weibo have made much effort on
struggling with the fake accounts, nevertheless, the effect is not very signiﬁcant.

Generally speaking, people purchase fake followers mainly for two motivates ac-
cording to the investigation from Theweek2. The ﬁrst one is that people purchase fol-
lowers just to achieve fame and feed their vanity. They misunderstand that, the more

the followers, the greater their inﬂuence. The second, some merchants or brands seek
a huge number of followers so as to push Ads. The follower merchants take advantage
of algorithms and softwares to produce a mass of fake accounts automatically. These
accounts act as real followers to meet the needs of their customers. There are already
some websites for trading fake twitter followers in public, such as [intertwitter.com] and
[fakefollowerstwitter.com]. The prices for 1K fake followers provided by these online
merchants are around 5-20$. A recent report from NYTimes pointed out that the fake
Twitter followers have become a multimillion-dollar business.

The fake followers are so epidemic in the micro-blogging systems, which have caused
plenty of hazards, such as making noise on personalized recommendation and user in-
ﬂuence analysis, risking privacy to unknown people, receiving valueless Ads. There-
fore, it is very signiﬁcant to present an effective method to distinguish the fake followers
from the legitimate users in micro-blogging systems. Researchers have developed effec-
tive tools3 based on the inactive characteristic and spam-related features to detect fake
followers of Twitter. However, the fake followers are distinguished to traditional spam-
mers. The spammers mainly utilize the freedom and rapid nature of micro-blogging
platforms to push unsolicited advertisements or malicious information[1], while fake
followers aim to follow the users who are urgent to be popular users. Therefore, in many
cases, fake followers do not send spam to others, and pretend to be legitimate users. At
the same time, fake followers in Sina Weibo seem to be more sophisticated than Twit-
ter’s. For they not only appear as active as the legitimate users, but also almost have no
spam in their posts. We have checked the tweets of the followers purchased from the
four markets (1000 followers each) manually. An account will be labeled as a spammer
once there is any spam appear in the most recent 20 tweets of its timeline. Finally, we
found about 62% of these fake Twitter followers are belong to spammers. We deﬁne the
accounts which have less than 10 posts or 10 followers as inactive accounts. In general,
57% of the fake followers for Twitter are inactive. However, according our statistic on
fake followers for Sina Weibo, the spammer-ratio and inactive-ratio are just 8% and 6%
respectively. As a result, we aim to address the issue of detecting the fake followers
for Sina Weibo in this paper. Considering that there are no related public datasets for
validating the effects of the proposed method, we just purchased a considerable number
of fake followers from different merchants as our datasets.

We frame our contributions as follows:

(1) We examine a number of properties of fake followers in Sina Weibo, and present

an effective strategy for automatic detection of fake followers.

(2) We give an in-depth analysis of the proﬁle-evolution of fake followers, and try to

understand the principles and algorithms for fake followers’ generation.

(3) We provide several suggestions for both the micro-blogging systems and legiti-

mate users on how to deal with fake followers.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After a brief review of the related work
in Section 2, we introduce datasets used in this paper in Section 3. Next, we analyze the
features of fake followers and propose a voting classier for detecting the fake followers

automatically in Section 4. Then, we present our experiments in Section 5. Section 6
gives the analysis on the results and the discussion. Finally, we conclude the paper in
Section 7 with future work.

2 Related Work

Due to its dual role of social network and news media[2], micro-blogging has become
an important platform for people to access information. However, with its rapid devel-
opment, micro-blogging is plagued by various credibility problems for a long time. The
information on micro-blogging systems has been polluted heavily by the rumors [3][4]
and the spams [5][6]. As fake followers usually accompany with illusive following-
actions, they will also pollute the social connections in the micro-blogging systems.

There are two main methods for the follower merchants to provide fake followers
to their customers. One way is to utilize some third-party applications to defraud the
authorizations from some legitimate users, then manipulate these compromised users to
follow the customers so as to promote their follower-count[7] [8]. Another method is
to utilize speciﬁc softwares to batch produce a mass of fake accounts that disguised as
real users.

The compromised users have a fatal weakness, that is their loyalty to the customers
is very low[9]. Since the compromised users are real users, once they discover strangers
appeared in their followee-list or receive valueless posts from the customers, they may
initiatively remove the customers from their followee-list. In contrast, the fake accounts
act as followers are very stable. Moreover, the fake followers have been very tricky,
especially in Sina Weibo. As a result, we mainly focus on how to automatically detect
the fake followers created by the follower merchants in this paper.

As the spammers in social networks are also created by certain bots [10]. Therefore,
the detection of spammers in social networks is related to our work. Thomas et al.
[11] analyzed the proﬁles of suspended spammers list provided by Twitter, then got
some signiﬁcant key points about the techniques of the spammers. [12] presented graph-
based methods to analyze the network structure of the spammers. In [13] [14] [15], the
researchers proposed feature-based systems to address the spammer-detection problem.
All of these works have provided meaningful investigation on the characteristics of the
forged accounts in social networks.

Our work is quite different from the works mentioned above, and presented as the
ﬁrst effort on detecting fake followers as far as we know. First, according to our real
dataset, only a small part of fake followers in Sina Weibo belong to spammers, and
thus the traditional methods for detecting the spammers in social networks are proved
not appropriate to identify fake followers. Secondly, previous approaches did not take
account of the evolution of fake accounts. We extract several evolutionary features for
our detection task, which are proved signiﬁcantly important to promote detection per-
formance.

3 Data Collection

We notice that fake followers have two kinds of following-behaviors: following the
customers who have purchased their service, and randomly following other users so

Automatic Fake Followers Detection in Chinese Micro-blogging System

as to disguise themselves. To investigate these two behaviors respectively, we collect
two different datasets. We buy 20,000 fake followers in Sina Weibo from 4 different
follower merchants, and use these followers on 4 new-created accounts4.

We keep monitoring these fake accounts for about 4 months(02/03/2013-30/06/2013),
and only 17 of them are suspended by Sina Weibo during this period. It means these
fake followers are very deceptive and seem to be good at disguising themselves. The re-
maining fake followers are made as our dataset(DATASET1) for the proposed method,
which contains 19,146 records after removing the duplicated ones.

20 new Sina Weibo accounts are registered and used as baits to attract randomly fol-
lowing from fake followers. We keep these baits no actions (no posts and no following
behaviors) for a long period(10/03/2013-15/06/2013), and recognize their followers as
fake follows since legitimate users only follow the users they are really interested in.
Totally, 724 accounts are captured by our baits and used as DATASET2.

In order to compare with fake followers, a dataset of legitimate users is also nec-
essary. 114 volunteers are invited to identify the accounts of their acquaintances from
their respective followee-list on Sina Weibo. In this way, 14,873 different accounts of
real users are obtained. We also crawl the accounts of 6,472 celebrities whose identity
have been ofﬁcially veriﬁed by Sina Weibo(”Big V”). After merging these two parts
of datasets, a legitimate dataset(DATASET3) contains 20,211 users. Finally, we utilize
Sina Weibo API5 to access the proﬁles of all users in DATASET1, DATASET2 and
DATASET3 for further research.

4 Proposed Method for Detecting Fake Followers

In this section, we mainly present our approach of detecting fake followers in Sina
Weibo. The fake followers detection issue can be considered as a binary classiﬁcation
task. Through comprehensive analysis of the datasets, we extract numerous features
with great discrimination between legitimate followers and fake followers to build the
classiﬁer. These features can be divided into three types: the post-related features, the
user relationship features and the evolutionary features. We randomly sample 2,000
items from DATASET1 and DATASET3 respectively, depict their differences on various
features, and provide a voting-SVM classiﬁer.

4.1 The User Relationship Features

The Ratio of Followee Count and Follower Count (RFF). RF F of fake followers
is surprisingly high due to their large number of followees and very few followers.
According to our statistics, for a typical legitimate user, this ratio is usually within a
range of [0.5,3]. Since some celebrities have a huge number of followers, their RF F
are often close to zero. RF F is shrunk with a logarithmic function as follows:

4 All these four merchants do not have public website. We get in touch with them via searching
in Sina Weibo with the keyword ”add followers”. The prices of them are all around ¥ 60-80
per 1K followers.

The Percentage of Bidirectional Friends (PBF). P BF is calculated with Equation
(2). In real scenarios, people have their own social communities, and often the legiti-
mate users belong to the same community always follow each other in micro-blogging
systems. Certainly, fake followers have no friends, no classmates and no colleagues,
therefore, their P BF should be lower than legitimate users’. The CDF curves of P BF
in Figure 1(b) have proven this assumption.

4.2 The Post-related Features

Average Repost Frequency of the Posts (ARF). ARF can reﬂect the inﬂuence of the
user[16]. The ARF of a fake follower is usually very low for two reasons. One reason
is that a fake follower has hardly any high quality followers. The other is that its post
behavior is manipulated by softwares, as a result, their posts are meaningless for others
in most cases. According to our datasets, the average ARF of normal users is much
higher than fake accounts. The CDF in Figure 1(c) shows that the ARF of most normal
users is over 0, which means the posts from normal users will be reposted at least once
in average. In contrast, it is obvious that over 80% of the fake followers have a low
ARF between [-2,-1].

Ratio of the Original Posts (ROP). We ﬁnd the vast majority of posts from fake
followers are belong to repost. In Figure 1(d), we ﬁnd that ROP for almost all fake
followers are less than 20%, while ROP for legitimate users are in the range of(20%-
60%).

Proportion of Nighttime Posts (PNP). We make a comparison of the post-timestamp
distributions of users in DATASET1 and DATASET3. We notice that legitimate users
rarely publish posts during the nighttime. However, the timestamp distribution of fake
followers obeys an approximative uniform distribution, which is contrary to the com-
mon sense since we all know that people need to sleep and with a very low probability
to publish posts in the middle of the night. Consequently, we suspect that the post-
creation behavior of fake followers is controlled by a periodic creation algorithm. As
the distributions in Figure 1(e) have shown a remarkable discrimination between fake
followers and legitimate users, we are conﬁdent to employ the proportion of nighttime
(1:00am-7:00am) posts as an indicator for classiﬁcation.

P N P (U ) =

T otalP ostsCount + 1

Topic Diversity. We apply author topic model[17] to mine the themes of the accounts
in DATASET1 and DATASET3. Normally, a legitimate user usually has countable in-
terests of topics, while the fake followers usually present variable interests since they
repost from others randomly. As a result, we assume that the topics of fake followers
should be more diverse than legitimate users. We use topic entropy [18] to measure
the topic diversity as Equation 6. Correspondingly, fake followers present higher topic
entropy than legitimate users’.

H(u) = − K(cid:4)

P (zi|u) log2 P (zi|u)

i=1

(6)

Where zi denotes the topics generated by author topic model. K is the count of

topics.

We notice that there is a step appears in the beginning of the CDF curve of fake
followers as shown in Figure 1(f). This is because a small part of fake followers publish
spams frequently, which causes their lower topic entropy.

4.3 The Evolutionary Features

As we observed, the fake followers always evolve when time changes. To better capture
the pattern of their evolution, we keep tracking the accounts in DATASET1 for a period
of 60 days (07/04/2013-06/06/2013), and several important parameters(i.e. the count of
posts, followees, followers) have been recorded every day. We then display the evolution
model of typical fake accounts in Figure 2 comparing with legitimate users6.

We can ﬁnd that the evolution of post-count of fake followers is consistent with
gradient trend every day, which means they share the same post-frequency. This also
implies that they are manipulated by the same algorithm. The evolutionary curves of
post-count from legitimate users in Figure 2(b) are ﬂatter than fake followers’. This is
because most of legitimate users publish fewer posts than fake followers and are with
low probability of mutation.

Because people rarely remove excessive amount of users from their followee-lists
during a short time[19], their followee count will tend to increase in general, whereas
the followee-count of ﬁve fake followers ﬂuctuate violently for many times as shown in
Figure 2(c). According to this surprising investigation, we are more conﬁdent to conﬁrm
that the fake followers are manipulated by software. In Sina Weibo, an account can only
follows 2,000 users at most, the software has to make the fake followers to remove some
followees who do not purchase their service in order to release the room for their new
customers.

The Figure 2(e) and Figure 2(f) demonstrate that follower-count of both fake follow-
ers and legitimate users maintain a relatively stable trend. However, the fake followers
seem to decrease more frequently.

Base on the analysis above, we extract 6 features to model the evolutionary

characteristics:

6 Due to the space limitation, we just plot 15-day evolution(23/05/2013-06/06/2013) in Figure 2.

(1) the standard deviation of post-count(σpost).
(2) the general slope of post-count(gpost).
(3) the standard deviation of followee-count(σf ollowee).
(4) the decrease frequency of followee-count(DFf ollowee).
(5) the standard deviation of follower-count (σf ollower).
(6) the decrease frequency of followee-count(DFf ollower).

Among these features, the three standard deviations are used to model the degree of
ﬂuctuation. The decrease frequency can capture the exceptions of followee-count and
follower-count. In addition, gpost is able to reﬂect the rate of increase of posts during
a period of time. We believe that these evolutionary features are also signiﬁcant for the
classiﬁcation task. For each account, we calculate these features above based on the
proﬁles in the latest 30 days, and integrate them into our classiﬁer.

4.4 Classiﬁer for Detecting Fake Followers

Due to its prominent fame on solving multidimensional classiﬁcation problem, we uti-
lize Support Vector Machine(SVM) as our basic classiﬁer. We exploit LibSVM[20] to
implement a SVM classiﬁer with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel function. Since
we do not know the actual proportion of fake followers in Sina Weibo, the classi-
ﬁer directly trained from the original dataset may be biased. To this end, we adopt
”bagging”[21] strategy to overcome this problem. DATASET1 and DATASET3 are
merged as the ﬁnal dataset(DATASET4), therefore, it contains 13,873 fake followers
and 20,211 legitimate users. 3,400 accounts in DATASET4 are stochastically selected
as test dataset, and the left is used as training dataset. We randomly sample 2,000 ac-
counts from DATASET4 for 15 times, then use 15 subsets to train a SVM classiﬁer
respectively. Finally, the category for an account in test dataset will be determined by
the voting results of these 15 SVM classiﬁers. A 10-fold cross validation on DATASET4
shows that our voting classiﬁer works well. The average accuracy is about 98.7%, and
the average false positive rate is very close to 0%.

5 Experiments

In this section, we ﬁrst make a comparison between our voting-SVM classiﬁer to several
baselines. Next, we utilize our proposed classiﬁer to evaluate the accounts in DATASET2

Fig. 2. The evolution of typical fake followers and legitimate users

which are attracted by our baits. Finally, we adopt our voting-SVM classiﬁer to detect
fake followers in the wild.

To examine the importance of evolutionary features, we implement a version of
voting-SVM classiﬁer with no evolutionary features. A normal SVM classiﬁer is em-
ployed as a baseline to validate the improvement of the ”bagging” strategy. We also
implement the spammer classiﬁer introduced in [13] as another baseline. Our voting-
SVM outperforms others with all the metrics as shown in Table 1. The evolutionary
features and the ”bagging” strategy both play an important role in the ﬁnal results. The
accuracy of spammer classiﬁer is much lower than others’. It is because most fake fol-
lowers in Sina Weibo do not have obvious spam-related characteristics.

As we observed, the suspicious accounts attracted by our baits in DATASET2 are
the features

very similar to fake followers in DATASET1 in many aspects(i.e.

discussed above), we guess that they have a great probability to be fake followers.
To prove our conjecture, we apply our trained voting-SVM classiﬁer to classify the
accounts in DATASET2. Up to 95.6% account in DATASET2 are judged as fake fol-
lowers, which indicates that the accounts in DATASET1 and DATASET2 are extremely
homogeneous. Therefore, we conﬁrm that most followers of our baits are indeed caused
by randomly following from fake followers.

In order to understand the global state in the whole Sina Weibo system, we pick up
100 legitimate users. Among the sampled accounts, 50 of them are registered by ordi-
nary people with different occupations. Another half are those celebrities in different
ﬁelds. We exploit our classiﬁer to analyze the quality of their followers, and the average
percentage of fake followers is about 37.2%. As listed in Table 2, the celebrity accounts
contain more fake followers than ordinary users. We guess that most celebrities have
the suspects on purchasing fake followers.

6.1 The Principle Behind Fake Followers

Based on all analysis mentioned above, we give an investigation on the behaviors and
characteristics of fake followers, which helps to ﬁnd several key points of principal
control algorithms behind fake followers in Sina Weibo:

(1) The fake follower merchants exploit certain register tools to produce massive

accounts in Sina Weibo.

(2) Then they make fresh fake accounts to follow each other, as a result, both the

followee-count and the follower-count will increase rapidly within a short time.

(3) Next, the fake accounts will send random following-action to many legitimate
users. On the one hand, this operation may attract some back-following from legitimate
users, which can improve their level of camouﬂage; for the other hand, the fake accounts
would get the source of the reposts.

(4) Since it is very complicated to automatically generate diverse posts with high
quality, so reposting the posts from legitimate users is a conservative method, especially

for those Chinese posts. The control algorithm manages fake accounts to repost many
posts every day, which not only ensures the quality of post-content, but also makes fake
followers appear to be much more realistic.

(5) When someone has purchased the fake-follow service, the merchants will manip-
ulate fake accounts to follow this customer, so as to make he/she appears to have many
followers.

(6) Once the followee-count of a fake follower is close to the limit(2,000 in Sina
Weibo), the control software will remove some legitimate users or other fake accounts
from the followee-list of fake followers.

6.2 How to Struggle with Fake Followers

It is a comprehensively difﬁcult work for micro-blogging systems to identify fake fol-
lowers. The micro-blogging services should make crucial measure to deal with fake
followers in a fair and just manner. We believe that our work provides quite good sug-
gestions for micro-blogging systems. As normal users, we need to be cautious to follow
others in micro-blogging systems, or we may receive many valueless reposts from fake
followers. We discover that fake followers prefer to choose to follow some novice users.
Due to their less experience, many novice users tend to follow back when they are fol-
lowed by fake followers. Also it is easy for a user to utilize the features above to judge
whether a follower is fake manually through P N P , RF F and OP R, since these fea-
tures of an account are public.

In fact, the count of followers alone means very little about the inﬂuence of a user[16].
As a result, it’s unnecessary for us to purchase followers. We should share this fact with
the customers of fake followers, so as to fundamentally undermine the follower market.

7 Conclusion

The fake followers have severely hurt the credibility of micro-blogging systems. In this
paper, we mainly focus on automatic detection of fake followers in Sina Weibo. We
extract many discriminative features especially several evolutionary features to build
a classiﬁer detecting fake followers. The proposed classiﬁer performs satisfactorily on
the standard metrics for classiﬁcation. We also summarize several principles behind
fake followers. Finally, we give suggestions for combating with fake followers.

Still there is much work to do in the future. We believe that the camouﬂage algo-
rithm of fake followers has huge space for improvement. The manipulator can adjust
the characteristics of fake followers to evade our detection algorithm. The race between
the detection algorithms and the camouﬂage strategies will exist for a long time. As a
result, it is necessary for us to keep tracking the evolution of fake followers and con-
stantly sum up new features to deal with them.
