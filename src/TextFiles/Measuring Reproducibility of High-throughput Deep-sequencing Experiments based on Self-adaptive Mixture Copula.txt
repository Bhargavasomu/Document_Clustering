Abstract. Measurement of the statistical reproducibility between bi-
ological experiment replicates is vital ﬁrst step of the entire series of
bioinformatics analysis for mining meaningful biological discovery from
mega-data. To distinguish the real biological relevant signals from ar-
tiﬁcial signals, irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) employing Copula,
which can separate dependence structure and marginal distribution from
data, has been put forth. However, IDR employed a Gaussian Copula
which may cause underestimation of risk and limit the robustness of the
method. To address the issue, we propose a Self-adaptive Mixture Cop-
ula (SaMiC) to measure the reproducibility of experiment replicates from
high-throughput deep-sequencing data. Simple and easy to implement,
the proposed SaMiC method can self-adaptively tune its coeﬃcients so
that the measurement of reproducibility is more eﬀective for general dis-
tributions. Experiments in simulated and real data indicate that com-
pared with IDR, the SaMiC method can better estimate reproducibility
between replicate samples.

Introduction

During the past years, the biological technology revolution, next-generation
high-throughput deep-sequencing, has produced mountains of data of DNA-Seq,
RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. This mega-data allows biologists to observe the signals
from tens of thousands of genes or related genomic elements in a single experi-
ment, a way that was not possible before. One question arises here: how many of
these signals are real biologically relevant? Generally, to avoid experiment noise
or error, two experiment replicates of one biological sample should be produced,
each of which has a collection of individual elements or signals such as a list of
genes or transcripts. Then we need to verify the reproducibility of each individ-
ual signal. Only the individual signals with high reproducibility are considered
as reliable results for further analysis such as diﬀerential gene expression iden-
tiﬁcation or GO analysis. Here reproducibility of a signal’s two observations in

two replicates is a measure of the conﬁdence that the two observations are con-
sistent with each other. Hereinafter it is shorted as “reproducibility of signal ”.
We propose a posterior probability to characterize the conﬁdence and also de-
ﬁne irreproducibility = 1 - reproducibility. By choosing a speciﬁc critical value,
each signal can be determined whether or not to be conﬁdent. It is worth noting
that we only have two replicates, two lists of observations of individual signals
but need to detect the reproducibility of each individual signal. Such extremely
small samples also lead to a big and diﬃcult challenging task to traditional data
mining where data are generally of remarkably larger size and density estimation
can be eﬀectively calculated based on these data.

IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate) which measures the reproducibility in
high-throughput experiments has been put forth by Li [1]. They proposed to
use copula, which can separate the dependency structure of random variables,
and a measurement based on copula to detect the high reproducible signals. A
remarkable advantage of copula is that it provides an eﬀective way to infer the
dependency structure between biological signals without knowing their respec-
tive marginal distribution, which is diﬃcult to obtain from real biological signals.
Reproducibility measure has been adopted as the standard of ENCODE (The
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project and has been carried on each signal of
all samples before these data are submitted to public database. The strategy of
IDR has been generalized to use on other data types such as RNA-Seq.

Although IDR has shown its ability of distinguishing the bona ﬁde signals
from artiﬁcial signals, it employed the Gaussian Copula, which assumes that the
dependence structure of random variables follows multivariate Gaussian distri-
bution. This assumption causes that the Gaussian Copula is sensitive to extreme
events and can not capture the asymmetric dependence structure [2]. In fact, de-
spite its simplicity, Gaussian Copula often leads to an underestimation of the
risk of the occurrence of joint extreme events [3, 4].Therefore, it is necessary to
develop a novel and eﬃcient approach to measure the reproducibility of replicate
data without stronger assumption to data distribution.

In this paper, we propose a Self-adaptive Mixture Copula, called SaMiC,
to measure the reproducibility of the high-throughput deep-sequencing experi-
ments. Unlike IDR, SaMiC doesn’t assume the dependence structure of random
variables to follow Gaussian distribution. SaMiC mixes several copulas and auto-
matically determines the mixture coeﬃcients based on the ﬁtness of the data and
the copulas. We prove theoretically that the new mixture copula is still a copula
so that it can be used to measure the reproducibilities. Simple and easy to imple-
ment, SaMiC is eﬀective and suitable for general distributions. Experiments in
both simulated data and real biological data of RNA transcripts expression from
human cells show that compared with IDR, SaMiC attains better performance
in distinguishing bona ﬁde signals from artiﬁcial signals.

The remainder of this paper is organized as following. In Section 2, we in-
troduce the development and preliminary of copulas. In Section 3 we detail our
proposed self-adaptive mixture copula and a novel measurement to detect the

reproducibility of experiments. In Section 4, we perform experiments in simu-
lated data and real data. In Section 5, we conclude the paper.

2 Related Work and Preliminary of Copula

As a tool of extracting the dependence structure from joint distributions of ran-
dom variables, copula was ﬁrst proposed by Sklar [5]. In his work, copula is
obtained by a two-stage procedure, i.e., estimating the marginal distribution of
each random variable followed by measuring the dependence structure between
diﬀerent random variables. Deheuvels proposed several empirical functions, i.e.,
the empirical copula of samples, to estimate the copula of population and con-
structed diﬀerent non-parametric dependence tests from samples [6]. However,
a well-recognized deﬁnition of copula hasn’t been given until Nelsen’s work [7].
There are two major categories in studying copulas: parameter estimation
and test of goodness of ﬁt. In the former category, Oakes and Genest proposed a
common strategy to estimate the parameters of bivariate copula [8,9]. Later, Joe
investigated the maximum likelihood estimation of parametric marginal distri-
bution and parametric copula [10]. Furthermore, Chen studied two stage semi-
parametric maximum likelihood estimation [11], and Abegaz derived asymptotic
properties of the marginal and copula parameter estimators [12].

In the aspect of test of goodness of ﬁt, an important goal is to measure how
well a copula describes the dependence structure among random variables since
it is closely related to the correctness of the proposed copula. According to the
copula model, test of goodness of ﬁt can be transformed into test of univariate
distribution. Then Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used to test the goodness of
ﬁt of copula. In this manner, Klugman used Q-Q plot to measure the rationality
of copula model [13]. Hu introduced M -statistics, which follows the chi-square
distribution, to measure goodness of ﬁt of copula model [14]. Engle proposed a
test method named “Hit” [15], and Patton expanded the test method “Hit” to
the nonlinear density model for checking the goodness of ﬁt [16]. Theses methods
can evaluate both the copula and the marginal distribution.

Since the function is useful to obtain the dependence structure of multivariate
random variables with few assumptions, it has been applied in ﬁnancial ﬁeld.
Embrechts employed copula for ﬁnancial risk management [17]. Hu proposed to
use mixed-copula to analyze the ﬁnancial data [14]. However, such a mixture
is not automatic and depends on experts’ experience. Recently, copula was also
employed in bioinformatics ﬁeld. For example, Kim discussed the application in
genetic data [18], Zhang used copula model to analyze ChIP-Seq data [19], and
Li proposed a new method based on copula model to measure reproducibility
of bioinformatics data [1]. A main reason of using copula in ﬁnancial and bioin-
formatics ﬁelds is that it can obtain the dependence structure without knowing
marginal distribution of random variables in advance. It is worth noting that
the above-mentioned copulas still require more or less assumptions to data dis-
tribution, which may limit its eﬀectiveness and extension. It is also noticeable
that in bioinformatics ﬁeld, copula is still a new tool of data analysis. For better
understanding, we introduce some preliminaries of copula as follows.

with margins F1 and F2. Then there exists a copula C such that

[5] Let H be a joint distribution function

(1)

H(x, y) = C(F1(x), F2(y)),

∀x, y ∈ R

If F1 and F2 are continuous, then C is unique; otherwise, C is uniquely deter-
mined on RanF1 × RanF2. Here RanF refers to the range of F . Conversely, if
C is a copula and F1 and F2 are distribution functions, then the function H is
a joint distribution function with margins F1 and F2.

Sklar’s Theorem shows that a joint distribution function can be divided into
each variable’s marginal distribution function and a copula which present their
statistical consistence. Therefore, it is possible to calculate copulas from joint
distribution function and its marginal distribution functions. From Sklar’s The-
orem we can get the follow properties, which are important to measure the
reproducibility of high-throughput deep-sequencing experiments:

Property 1. Let G(X1, X2,··· , Xn) be a joint distribution function of n
random variables X1, X2,··· , Xn, F1(x1), F2(x2),··· , Fn(xn) are marginal dis-
tribution functions of these random variables and C(u1, u2,··· , un) is the cor-
responding copula, then for every u = (u1, u2,··· , un) ∈ [0, 1]n it satisﬁes that

be its density function and F1, F2,··· , Fn are marginal distribution functions of

the random variables, we can get that

g(X1, X2,··· , Xn) = c(F1(X1), F2(X2),··· , Fn(Xn))

Currently, there are two main types of commonly-used copulas: Elliptical cop-
ulas and Archimedean copulas. Elliptical copulas are a kind of copulas with
contoured elliptical distributions, such as Gaussian copula and t-copula. Easy to
construct, Elliptical copulas don’t have a closed form of function expression, and
all of them are radially symmetric and hard to extend to high-dimensional situa-
tion. As a result, it is diﬃcult to use Elliptical copulas to describe unpredictable
dependence structures or adapt to complex situations.

Diﬀerent from Elliptical copulas, Archimedean copulas are an associative class

of copulas which satisfy the following equations:

C(u1, u2,··· , un) = ϕ

−1(ϕ(u1) + ϕ(u2) + ··· + ϕ(un))

(4)
where ϕ(·) is usually called the generator of Archimedean copula. Among a lot
of Archimedean copulas, three frequently used Archimedean copulas are Frank

Measuring Reproducibility

Copula, Clayton Copula and Gumbel Copula. Speciﬁcally, the reproducibility
structures of Frank Copula and the variables drawn from Frank Copula are
symmetric in both tails of their distributions. So any asymmetric consistence
between random variables can’t be captured using Frank Copula. Clayton Copula
is sensitive to the low tail dependence of random variables, and can easily capture
the changes around the low tail. Finally, Gumbel Copula is sensitive to the upper
tail dependence of random variables.

3 The Proposed SaMiC Approach

It is obvious that each copula has its respective pros and cons in diﬀerent dis-
tributions. To deal with more general distributions, we propose self-adaptive
mixture copula, which is a linear combination of several copulas. For simpliﬁca-
tion, we discuss the proposed copula in two-dimensional situation.

Deﬁnition 1 (Mixture Copula). A function is called mixture copula if it
satisﬁes: CM (u, v) =
i=1 αi = 1. Here
C1(u, v), C2(u, v),··· , Cm(u, v) are copulas and α1, α2,··· , αm are linear coeﬃ-

cients of CM (u, v).

We prove that CM (u, v) is a copula, which will be introduced in a extended
version due to the length limitation. To self-adaptively estimate the linear coef-
ﬁcients of the proposed mixture copulas, we utilize Pearson χ2 statistic pro-
posed by Hu to measure the goodness of ﬁt of each copula [14], i.e., M =
(cid:3)k
, where Ai,j and Bi,j denote the number of observed and pre-
dicted frequencies in cell (i, j) of a contingency table, respectively. The details
on the contingency table can be referred to as Hu [14]. M follows χ2 distribution
with (k−1)2 degree of freedom. Given a total of m base copulas, C1, C2,··· , Cm,
we can attain m results, MC1, MC2,··· , MCm. Because MCi follows χ2 distri-
bution, we can get probability βi from MCi. In fact βi is the probability that
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between copula Ci and the data. Because of the
additivity of chi-squared distribution, let αi =
i=1 βi be the mixing coeﬃcient
of Ci, then the proposed self-adaptive mixture-copula is

Since our self-adaptive method chooses coeﬃcients automatically, it can deal
with more general distributions. By contrast, the ordinary mixture copula man-
ually selects the coeﬃcients, heavily depending on human experience and need
lots of tuning for each new group of data [14]. Consequently, it is only applicable
to some speciﬁc distributions.

To measure the statistical consistency or reproducibility based on the pro-
posed self-adaptive mixture copula, we here consider the situation with two
rows of observations for simpliﬁcation. The reason is that when observations

306

Q. Zhang, J. Zhang, and C. Xue

subject to independent identically distribution, it is not diﬃcult to expand to
multivariate situation if we use a pairwise analysis to them.

Formally, let the two rows of observations, (x1,1, x1,2),··· , (xn,1, xn,2), be two

replicates of n random signals. We assume that the observations consist of a
more reproducible group and a less reproducible one, and π0 and π1 denote
the proportion of the less reproducible group and the more reproducible group,
respectively. Let parameter Ki be an indicator to identify whether or not a signal
belong to the more or less reproducible group. Ki = 1 if the i-th signal belong to
the more reproducible group, and Ki = 0 if it is in the less reproducible group.
Obviously, the signals in the more or less reproducible group have diﬀerent
probability distributions. We assume that the dependence structures of the two
observations of signals in the more and less reproducible groups are induced by
z1 = (z1,1, z1,2) and z0 = (z0,1, z0,2), respectively. According to Sklar’s Theorem,
any multivariate probability distribution can be divided into its marginal proba-
bility distributions and its copula. In other words, it provides a way to infer the
reproducibility among several random variables without knowing their marginal
distributions in advance. Thus, we construct our parametric model as follows:

Let Ki ∼ Bernoulli(π1) and (zi,1, zi,2) be distributed as (zi,1, zi,2) | Ki = k ∼

Sk(u, v), k = 0, 1, and

Sk(zi,1, zi,2) = C(F1(zi,1), F2(zi,2); λk),

k = 0, 1

(6)

where F1(zi,1) and F2(zi,2) are the marginal distributions of zi,1 and zi,2, respec-
tively. And λk denotes the relevant parameter of copula. Then considering (6),
the total distribution function is

S(zi,1, zi,2) = P{Zi,1 ≤ zi,1, Zi,2 ≤ zi,2} = π0S0(zi,1, zi,2) + π1S1(zi,1, zi,2)
πkC(F1(zi,1), F2(zi,2); λk)

(cid:4)

=

(7)

k=0,1

In this equation, our actual observations (xi,1, xi,2) are used to estimate the
cumulative distribution function of (zi,1, zi,2). From (3) we can get the density
functions of S0(zi,1, zi,2) and S1(zi,1, zi,2) as follows:

sk(zi,1, zi,2) = c(F1(zi,1), F2(zi,2); λk)f1(zi,1)f2(zi,2),

k = 0, 1,

(8)

where f1(zi,1) and f2(zi,2) are the density functions of F1(zi,1) and F2(zi,2),
respectively. From (7) and (3), therefore, the density function of S(zi,1, zi,2) is

(cid:4)

s(zi,1, zi,2) =

πkc(F1(zi,1), F2(zi,2); λk)f1(zi,1)f2(zi,2)

(9)

k=0,1

Up to now, our model is parametrized by θ = (π0, λ0, λ1) and F1, F2. The
parameters can be attained using maximum likelihood estimation as:

L(θ) =

(f1(xi,1)f2(xi,2)

πkc(F1(xi,1), F2(xi,2); λk)).

(10)

i=1

k=0,1

307

Note that selecting diﬀerent Archimedean copulas in (6) will lead to diﬀerent
forms of S(zi,1, zi,2). Since

CM (u, v; θ) = π0C(u, v; λ0) + (1 − π0)C(u, v; λ1)

(11)

is also a copula, the formula (7) can be rewritten as S(zi,1, zi,2) = CM (F1(zi,1),
F2 (zi,2); θ), where the form of the ﬁnal copula CM (u, v) is determined by the
selection of Archimedean copulas in (6).
When several Archimedean copulas C(1)(u, v), C(2)(u, v), ··· , C(m)(u, v) are
substituted into (6), the corresponding parameters θ(1), θ(2), ··· , θ(m) can be es-
timated from (10), where θ(i) = (π(i),0, λ(i),0, λ(i),1). After that, we substitute the
obtained copulas CM(1)(u, v; θ(1)), CM(2)(u, v; θ(2)), ··· , CM(m)(u, v; θ(m)) into
the method of generating self-adaptive mixture-copula. Because CM(i)(u, v; θ(i))
is also a mixture-copula, we get the linear coeﬃcients α = (α1, α2,··· , αm) and

attain the ﬁnal mixture-copula as:

CR(u, v) =

m(cid:4)

i=1

αiCM(i)(u, v; θ(i))

(12)

where αi is the linear coeﬃcient. Since CM(i)(u, v; θ(i)) is also a mixture-copula,
CR(u, v) can be decomposed into

CR(u, v) =

m(cid:4)

v; λ(i),1) are the more and less reproducible groups, respectively.

i=1 αiπ(i),0C(i)(u, v; λ(i),0) and CR,1 =

Once CR(u, v) is determined, it is easy to update the total distribution func-

tion of the data as

SR(zi,1, zi,2) ≡ SR,0(zi,1, zi,2) + SR,1(zi,1, zi,2),

(14)

and thus

sR(zi,1, zi,2) =
cR,0(F1(zi,1), F2(zi,2))f1(zi,1)f2(zi,2) + cR,1(F1(zi,1), F2(zi,2))f1(zi,1)f2(zi,2)

(15)

where sR ,cR and sR,k are density functions of SR, CR and sR,k, respectively.

Finally, we can estimate the irreproducibility of each signal based on:

the parameters α, θ(i) and the indicators Ki of each signal, we propose an eﬀec-
tive two-stage one-dimensional optimization method. It’s worth noting that we
use empirical marginal CDFs ˆF1(xi,1) and ˆF2(xi,2) instead of using raw data di-
rectly, where ˆFj (xi,j ) =
j = 0, 1, since it makes experiments compa-
rable and the rank statistic tends to cope better with real-world systematic biases
and errors. The pseudo-code of our estimation procedure is shown in Alg. 1.

Compared with the IDR proposed by Li [1], a remarkable advantage of our
algorithm is that it is more eﬀective since it only needs to do one-dimensional
optimization search for no more than 2km times, where k is the threshold of it-
erations. So its asymptotic time complexity is O(mn). The actual running time of
our algorithm is also aﬀected by the selected threshold of precision and iterations.

4 Experiments

To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of our proposed SaMiC approach, we compare it
with IDR proposed by Li [1] in two simulated data with remarkably diﬀerent
marginal distributions and reproducibility structures and one real biological
data. Note that although IDR has four values to be initialized, we found that
they have less inﬂuence to the analysis of the ﬁnal results. We chose Frank Cop-
ula, Clayton Copula and Gumbel Copula that all from Archimedean family as
base copulas since these copulas have high potential of extending from bivariate
Archimedean copulas to multivariate ones.

4.1 Simulated Data

In the ﬁrst experiment, we generate two rows of 10,000 numbers which follow
normal distributions N (0, 1) and N (2, 12), respectively. Then we consider these
numbers as 10,000 signals’ two observations to detect their (ir)reproducibilities.
For the two rows of numbers generated from diﬀerent distributions, there’s little

chance that these signals’ two observations are conﬁdently consistent. So we
expected the (ir)reproducibilities are low (high). Then we use both IDR and
SaMiC to measure the (ir)reproducibilities of these signals. Note that both IDR
and SaMiC output the irreproducibilities in [0, 1]. The results shown in Fig. 1
indicate that IDR has a lower recognition rate to discover the irreproducible
signals. For example, if we regard those signals whose irreproducibilities are less
than 0.5 are reproducible, then many irreproducible signals will be classiﬁed to
be reproducible. In contrary, our SaMiC approach can correctly classify most
irreproducible signals even when the cutoﬀ value is set to be 0.9.

In the second experiment, we wish to test whether our SaMiC can be suit-
able for a more general distribution. Thus, we generated two rows of 10,000
random numbers combined from two diﬀerent types of distributions. Firstly,

we generated 5,000 random numbers (t1, t2,··· , t5000) from Chi-square distribu-
tion T ∼ Γ (2, 14), and 10,000 random numbers (a1, a2,··· , a10000) from beta
distribution A ∼ β(3, 3). Let the ﬁrst row be (a1, a2,··· , a10000) and the sec-
ond row be (t1, t2,··· , t2500, a2501, a2502,··· , a7500, t2501, t2502,··· , t5000). From

Fig. 1 it’s obvious that IDR failed to distinguish the irreproducible signals. In

310

Q. Zhang, J. Zhang, and C. Xue

Fig. 2. HeLa-S3: The log-proportion vs. irreproducibility ﬁgure of IDR (left) and
SaMiC (right)

contrast, SaMiC can estimate the (ir)reproducibilities of signals in experiment
2 with high conﬁdence. The reason is that SaMiC makes less assumption to the
dependence structure of observations, and the self-adaptive mixture copula is
helpful to be suitable for general distributions.

We also use both kernel and Gaussian density estimation on these data of
the two above experiments. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the results from density
estimation can show the diﬀerences between two rows of numbers only in an
overall perspective. So it’s hard to decide whether or not to trust some spe-
ciﬁc signals that are reproducible by using density estimation. In contrast, our
method attains the (ir)reproducibility of each signal, which can distinguish bona
ﬁde signals from artiﬁcial signals.

4.2 Real Data

We also use real biological data to test the performance of SaMiC. The data
can be downloaded from “http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19
&g=wg EncodeCshlLongRnaSeq” (selected categories: Cell Line = HeLa-S3, Lo-
cation = cell, RNA Extract = Long PolyA+ RNA, View: Transcript Gencode
V7). This data was generated by ENCODE project [20] and they are biological
experiments to detect the expression level of HeLa-S3 cell’s long RNA tran-
scripts, which were sequenced by RNA-Seq. The downloaded data ﬁle contains
161,999 annotated transcript individuals’ expression values — the normalized
RPKM values. As need, each transcript has two values from diﬀerent exper-
iment replicates respectively. They are estimated by SaMiC and IDR to test
their performance. Diﬀerent from some classical data mining problems, it’s dif-
ﬁcult to verify the experiment results on real data because of lacking test data
or labels. So we need to analyze the results in some indirect ways.

Intuitively, the larger (or smaller) the proportion of a signal’s two observa-
tions is, the smaller probability that the signal is reproducible. In fact, SaMiC
scores are diﬀerent from proportions because proportions only consider local
information while SaMiC scores rely on both the entire distribution and the
dependence structure of the observations. Nevertheless, it still can demonstrate
some diﬀerences between IDR and SaMiC by using ﬁgure of proportions versus

irreproducibilities. As shown in Fig. 2, we draw this ﬁgure by putting logarithm of
proportion on x-axis and irreproducibility on y-axis. From Fig. 2 we can see that
SaMiC is more sensitive and has a stronger recognizing ability. Take signals in
(−∞,−2]∪ [2,∞) with irreproducibilities lower than 0.2 for example. The num-
ber of irreproducible signals estimated by IDR is remarkably larger than that
estimated by SaMiC. It shows that SaMiC is more sensitive to (ir)reproducibility
and can identify the irreproducible signals which are ignored by IDR.

For the convenience of subsequent data analysis, such as keeping speciﬁc pro-
portion of data or choosing diﬀerent critical values, we expect the irreproducibil-
ities to be smooth. In order to compare IDR and SaMiC from this viewpoint,
we produce the cumulative distribution curves of the results from both IDR and
SaMiC. From Fig. 3 we observe that the curve of SaMiC is smoother than that
of IDR. Besides, compared with IDR, SaMiC can provide more detailed data
for keeping speciﬁc proportion of data. For example, if we want to get the sig-
nals with the lowest 20% irreproducibilities, it’s easy while using SaMiC but
unavailable while using IDR. This is because that there are almost 40% irrepro-
ducibilities that are 0 in the result of IDR, which means IDR fails to discriminate
the signals with 40% lowest irreproducibilities while SaMiC succeeds. So SaMiC
performs better on selecting the most reliable signals with a speciﬁc proportion.
Furthermore, we perform more experiments on another three diﬀerent types
of cells including GM12878, H1-hesc and K562, which are downloaded from the
same website as HeLa-S3. For saving space, the detailed results can be found in
future extended version. Based on these experiments, we give a comparison on
running time. As shown in Fig. 3, SaMiC works faster than IDR on all of the
four data. The computing environment is Intel Core2 2.93GHz with 4G memory.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a Self-adaptive Mixture Copula to measure
the reproducibility of high-throughput deep-sequencing experiments, which is a
diﬃcult and challenging data mining problem since the number of samples is
extremely small. The proposed SaMiC can eﬀectively separate the dependence
structure from joint distribution of signals without priori assumption. Compared
with IDR, SaMiC can discover the irreproducible signals in a more reliable way.

SaMiC features no parameters that need to be tuned and can calculate the
(ir)reproducibilities in an automatic way. It can self-adaptively choose the most
suitable parameters for given data and is thus robust for diﬀerent datasets.
Besides, SaMiC works faster than IDR on all data we tested.

SaMiC can be used in all high-throughput deep-sequencing experiments that
produce over one replicate to avoid reducing the conﬁdence of experimental
results. Actually, the reproducibility issue exists for a great number of researches
so that the method of estimating reproducibility has a wide application.

In the future, we will compare SaMiC with other methods such as FDR.
Furthermore, we will do more experiments with labeled data and investigate
more application ﬁelds of SaMiC.
