Abstract. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework and novel
methodology geared towards mapping technological change in complex
interdependent systems by using large amounts of unstructured data
from various recent on- and oﬄine sources. Combining techniques from
the ﬁelds of natural language processing and network analysis, we are
able to identify technological ﬁelds as overlapping communities of knowl-
edge fragments. Over time persistence of these fragments allows to ob-
serve how these ﬁelds evolve into trajectories, which may change, split,
merge and ﬁnally disappear. As empirical example we use the broad area
of Technological Singularity, an umbrella term for diﬀerent technologies
ranging from neuroscience to machine learning and bioengineering, which
are seen as main contributors to the development of artiﬁcial intelligence
and human enhancement technologies. Using a socially enhanced search
routine, we extract 1,398 documents for the years 2011-2013. Our anal-
ysis highlights the importance of generic interface that ease the recom-
bination of technology to increase the pace of technological progress.
While we can identify consistent technology ﬁelds in static document
collections, more advanced ontology reconciliation is needed to be able
to track a larger number of communities over time.

Keywords: Technological change, transition, technology forecasting,

detection, dynamic community detection.

Introduction

Understanding the pattern of technological change is a crucial precondition
to formulate meaningful long-term research and industry policy. Technological
change usually happens along technological trajectories [1] focusing its pathway
within a scientiﬁc paradigm [2]. Apart from deﬁning the boundaries, a paradigm

often provides a set of generic technology artifacts which can be deployed along
multiple trajectories [3]. Furthermore, recent trends towards modularization and
the development of common interfaces have led to an increasing compatibility
of technologies within and between paradigms. We argue that today we face an
accelerating deterioration of burdens for technology (re-)combination through
growing complementary of components [4,5]. In order to understand innovation
activity in many modern technological ﬁelds, it therefore becomes pivotal to de-
ploy conceptual frameworks, methods, and data geared towards the analysis of
such dynamic and highly interdependent systems.

Common approaches to analyze technological change are yet limited to quali-
tative in-depth case studies [6,7], quantitative methods depending on data such
as patents [8] or scientiﬁc publications [9], and more generic simulation models
[10,11]. While undeniably useful, they either require massive eﬀort to qualita-
tively analyze complex interaction patterns in technological space, or rely on
quantitative data only available with non-negligible time delay, and only rele-
vant for certain technology domains, often underestimating the context in which
technology is used. During the last decade we have witnessed tremendous growth
of freely available digital information, often in the form of unstructured text data
from sources such as web-sites and blogs, written communication of communities
in forums or via e-mail, and knowledge repositories (e.g. SSRN, Researchgate).
The topicality and sheer amount of such data bear great opportunities for social
science research in general, and particularly to timely analyze complex techno-
logical change, as we attempt to demonstrate in the following.

In this paper we present a framework and suggest a set of methods to map
technological change by using large amounts of unstructured text data from
various on- and oﬄine sources. We conceptualize technological change as the
reconﬁguration of interaction patterns between technology fragments, and their
clustering in space to technological ﬁelds, and in time to technological trajectories.
To analyze such change, we propose the combination of techniques from the ﬁelds
of natural language processing (NLP) and network analysis. We use the case of
technological singularity to illustrate our approach graphically as well as with
key measures derived from network analysis.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews and dis-
cusses literature and concepts of technological change, and provides a theoretical
framework for our approach. In Section 3 we suggest a set of methods suitable
to analyze such a framework, and illustrate it in Section 4 at the case of singu-
larity technologies. Finally, Section 5 concludes, provides implications for theory,
empirical research, and suggests applications for science and industry policy.

2 Conceptualization and Analysis of Technological

Change

2.1 Conceptualization of Technological Change

The conceptualization of technological change has a long tradition in diﬀerent
academic communities. Generally, technology exists to fulﬁll or support some

Mapping the (R-)Evolution of Technological Fields

societal functions through direct application or indirectly through derived prod-
ucts. It is thus always embedded in and framed by a societal, political and
organizational context, which co-evolves with it [12]. It is also understood as
happening within broader scientiﬁc paradigms [2].

Scholars studying industrial dynamics further describe the development of
technology as contextual to the evolution of industrial structures [1,13]. Tech-
nology is envisioned as a mean to problem solving in a particular context, which
could usually be solved in various other ways using other technologies. Techno-
logical trajectories represent pathways spanning across the technological space
delimited by the paradigm [1], focusing the problem solving process over time
around one possible conﬁguration of technologies. While this process usually
unfolds gradually, sometimes signiﬁcant technological discontinuities punctuate
a trajectory [14]. Such disruptive change radically alters a trajectory’s or even
paradigm’s internal logic, or completely replaces it in an act of Schumpeterian
creative destruction [18]. Overall that suggests competition between substitu-
tional trajectories. Yet, they can also be compatible and complementary to each
other, since generic technological artifacts may feed the progress of multiple
trajectories.

Drawing on work in theoretical biology [16], technological evolution can be
conceived as a recombinatory process of novel and existing component tech-
nologies within complex adaptive systems [17]. Innovative recombinations can
address fundamentally diﬀerent problems from the ones that were initially tar-
geted within the components’ paradigms. This comes close to a Schumpeterian
understanding, where the innovation process is envisioned as the recombination
of existing resources in a novel way [18]. The result of such a development can
also be envisioned as a complex system with a number of elements that collec-
tively fulﬁll a single or various goals [19]. A main characteristic of such complex
systems is a high degree of interdependence (or epistasis), meaning a functional
sensitivity of a system to changes in constituent elements [17]. Thus, a change
in one element will aﬀect not only aﬀect its own but also the functioning of
epistatically related ones [20]. Since the complexity of the system increases with
the number of elements and their degree of interdependence, in large epistatic
systems one faces a complexity catastrophe, making it increasingly hard to ﬁnd
useful combinations [17].

A possible solution suggested to avoid the complexity catastrophe is to increase
the systems modularity [4,5,21]. This approach aims at the development of stan-
dardized interfaces between more discrete elements to mediate interdependence
[22], thus allowing to decrease the overall complexity while maintaining the num-
ber of possible recombinations. Modularity and common interfaces further ease
the way to combine and recombine components stemming from diﬀerent trajec-
tories, perhaps even diﬀerent paradigms. On a higher level, technological revo-
lutions disrupting current techno-economic paradigms are usually accompanied
by the emergence of such modules, which can be deployed in various contexts
[14]. A recent and very obvious example for this development, the smartphone,
is illustrated in Figure 1. The combination of voice and data communication

362

with GPS, camera, compass and accelerometer technologies, bound together by
a miniature touchscreen-computer, opened up for a uncountable number of not
anticipated applications. Various standardized wireless connection technologies
like bluetooth or WiFi allow for compatibility with many other external devises,
thus increasing the functionality and re-purposing the phone.

We argue that today we are witnessing a rapid decline of the burdens to
technology-combination through eﬃcient modularization between components
within artifacts such as the smartphone. Embracing this line of thought, we
aim to develop a framework and methodology geared towards the analysis of
evolving interdependent technology systems. Such a framework has to be able to
capture the ongoing incremental adjustment of interaction pattern between its
components (technological evolution) as well as disruptive changes fundamentally
altering the systems logic (technological revolution).

2.2 Measurement and Analysis of Technological Change

Existing empirical research on technological change can broadly be divided in
three ﬁelds. Work from scholars associated with the Science, Technology and
Society (STS) tradition mainly relies on detailed ethnographic studies of the
complex multidimensional setup around technological systems, and sheds light
on the variety of factors that inﬂuence and shape its development [23,24,25].

A stream of more positivistic research in the ﬁelds of industrial economics and
sciencometrics is primarily based on patent and scientiﬁc publication data as an
approximation for technological development. Research so far mostly incorpo-
rates patent data as aggregated numbers to explain diﬀerences in scale [26], or in
a network representation to explain structural diﬀerences [8,27] in the develop-
ment of technologies across countries and industries. Patent data has also been
used to study invention as a recombination process [17,28,29].1

Most recently, social scientists have also started to deploy methods from the
ﬁelds of computational linguistic and NLP to advance empirical research on
the development of science and technology [32,33,34,35]. In their essence, such
linguistically informed methods are capable of identifying patterns of language
usage in large bodies of text and communication. They range from simple mea-
sures of word co-occurrence across documents, corpora and over time [36], to
complex linguistically informed probability model [37,38,39].

We perceive the latter as a fruitful way to analyze technological change, im-
plicitly accounting for the socio-economic context in which it is embedded. Such
an approach integrates the broad multidimensional perspective of qualitative re-
searchers, that very importantly emphasizes the role of technology users, organi-
zations and governments in innovation processes, with quantitative objectivity
given by the machine learning based methodology.

1 However, besides its merits and easy accessibility, there are widely recognized limits
in the use of patent data [30,31] such as the high variation of importance across
industries and countries, and over time and the long delay between the time research
is conducted and the corresponding patent publication.

2.3 Technology Evolution as Structural Network Change

We conceptualize technology as a system of interdependent components [40]
within their respective trajectories of development [1]. Representing such sys-
tems of interacting elements as networks has brought fresh perspectives and
insights to the analysis of complex phenomena from the biological to the so-
cial sciences [41]. Embracing this approach, we attempt to analyze technological
change as the ongoing structural reconﬁguration of interaction between elements
in a technology network, which allows us to deploy the rich set of network anal-
ysis.

On the lowest level of aggregation in a network representing a technological
system, one ﬁnds what we call technology fragments. They represent atomic,
non-reducible repositories of scientiﬁc/technological knowledge needed to fulﬁll
certain narrow tasks. Scientiﬁc, technological and industrial applications such as
machines, software and other devices (which we call technological artifacts) com-
bine technology fragments in a functional relationship to produce some output.
In our previous example, GPS devices, touchscreens and WiFi receivers represent
technology fragments, which combined in a functional relationship can resemble
the smartphone, a technological artifact. On a higher level, sets of complemen-
tary and substitutional artifacts form atechnological ﬁeld (which could be, let’s
say mobile applications and devices). Over time, such ﬁelds develop along tech-
nological trajectories, where accumulated sets of common conﬁguration patterns
reproduce over time and set the foundation for further combinations. Again,
fragments and artifacts originating from one ﬁeld might be reconﬁgured and
redeployed in a diﬀerent ﬁeld to fulﬁll the same or even a diﬀerent purpose.
Furthermore, fragments as well as artifacts might not even mainly belong to one
ﬁeld, but be equally employable across multiple ﬁelds.

In summary, our conceptualization of technological change, and the suggested

methods to analyze it, is based on the following assumptions:

Assumption 1: Knowledge fragments are atomic, non-reducible repositories

of scientiﬁc/technological knowledge

Assumption 2: Technology fragments can be arbitrary combined and recom-

bined to resemble functional technological artifacts of varying quality

Having clariﬁed the elements (or edges) in such a network, one has to decide
how to measure the functional relationships between them. In our case, identify-
ing technology fragments in unstructured text data, we have to add the following
assumption:

Assumption 3: Co-location of technology fragments in documents imply a

functional relationship between them

3 Analyzing Technology Evolution: Dynamic Semantic

Network Approach

After providing a conceptual framework to analyze technological change, in this
section we suggest a set of methods to empirically study such changes. A illus-
tration of the method pipeline is provided in Figure 5.

3.1 From Unstructured Text to Technology Fragments: Entity

Extraction

First obvious choice to be made is which corpus of technology related text doc-
uments one wants to analyze. Such a corpus should optimally (i.) consist of
technology related writings (ii.) ranging equally distributed over a time suﬃ-
cient to observe technological change, and (iii.) not be biased towards particular
technologies within the system. Examples for such data are scientiﬁc publica-
tions, patent descriptions, articles in industry journals, but also online sources
such as collections of tech-blogs. In Section 4 we illustrate how to generate an
online data corpus with socially enhanced web scraping techniques.

In a next step, it is necessary to convert the unstructured text documents to a
machine readable representation.2 For our means, the goal is to reduce each doc-
ument to the contained technological concepts. Instead of using a probabilistic
approach that stepwise excludes text-elements that are deﬁnitely not a technol-
ogy, we try to detect mentioned technologies in the data. This task falls into the
category of named entity extraction, which typically relies on tagged dictionaries
and string-matching rules to identify the required concepts.

A number of applications related to this development target the identiﬁca-
tion of diﬀerent concepts in unstructured text, among others technological and
industrial terms. The advantage of these semantic web tools is that they are sup-
ported by large, centralized, constantly updated and optimized dictionaries and
intelligent disambiguation functions. The result of a successful entity extraction
returns a collection of documents that only contain the mentioned technology
terms and their document appearance frequency. Referring to our conceptual
framework in Section 2, the extracted technology term resemble the elements
(nodes) in our technological system, which we label as technology fragments.

3.2 From Technology Fragments to a Network: Vector Space

Modelling

After having deﬁned the nodeset in our network of technology fragments, we
have to create weighted edges between them, representing their technological
relatedness and interaction. In a ﬁrst step we construct a (hierarchical) 2-mode
network between technology fragments and the corresponding documents they
occur in. We weight the edges by the pairwise cosine similarity between the
vectors of the technology fragment and document within a vector space, which
we deﬁne by by training a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model [42,43] on the

2 Typically, this takes the format of a bag of words (BOW), a line-up of thematically
relevant keywords, usually nouns and bi-gram noun phrases. The key assumption of
this type of NLP applications is that statistically signiﬁcant co-occurrence patterns
of concepts across the corpus is indicative for actual association between them.

Mapping the (R-)Evolution of Technological Fields

365

full corpus of documents.3 Thus, our measure of edge weight indicates to which
extent the term representing the technology fragment is semantically close to the
entirety of other terms contained by the document (see. Section 5). To map tech-
nological change over time, we do this separated for every observation period.

While the entirety of technology fragments is stable over time, documents ob-
viously experience a 100% turnover in population every observation period. To
coerce a stable nodeset, we project the 2-mode to a weighted 1-mode network in
technology space. Again, the underlying rationale is based on the assumption that
co-occurrence in documents - at least on an aggregated level - also corresponds to
a functional relationship between technology fragments. However, on a document
level that will not always be true. While some documents may discuss technology
in the realm of one particular technological ﬁelds, others might serve more as an
overview on industry or research of a broader context, hence contain a collection
of technological fragments from many otherwise distinct ﬁelds. Thus, we penalize
documents containing more technology fragments in a similar spirit as the method
used by [44], represented by the following equation [45]. Here wij represents the
edge-weight between node i and j, and p the corresponding documents.

wi,p
Np − 1

wij =

(cid:2)

p

We end up with a one-mode network of technology fragments connected by the
pairwise projected semantic similarity values, associated with the corresponding
period. Figure 3 illustrates these nodeset properties in dynamic networks.

Identifying Technological Fields: Overlapping Community Detection.
We depict technological change as the structural reconﬁguration of micro level in-
teractions between technology fragments. When analyzing the structure, function,
and dynamics of networks, it is extremely useful to identify sets of related nodes,
known as communities, clusters, or partitions [46]. Such communities of closely
connected technologies resemble what we call a technological ﬁeld, a set of comple-
mentary or substitutional technologies following one technological trajectory, and
clustering over time around a common objective. Therefore, we attempt to identify
technological ﬁelds using a community detection algorithm of choice.4

3 Before training the model, we apply TF-IDF weights to all terms within the docu-
ments. This appreciates the value of particularly important terms for the single docu-
ment, while depreciating the value of generic terms that often occur across the corpus.
Here we have chosen the established LSI algorithm for training the vector space model
but other algorithms e.g. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) or Random Projections
would also be feasible to calculate pairwise cosines.

4 An alternative approach would be to use to identify technological ﬁelds by the us-
ing topic modeling, an approach that lately started to gain traction in social science
[35,34,37], create a two-mode network of terms and topics, and project it to an one-
mode network of terms. However, for reasons described we here want to oﬀer an alter-
native, where the topics are already identiﬁed using the powerful community detection
methods oﬀered by network analysis.

366

R. Jurowetzki and D.S. Hain

Early clustering and community detection algorithms, in network analysis and
elsewhere, usually assumed that the membership of entities to one distinct group.
However, depending on the meaning of edges and nodes, many real life networks
show a high overlap of communities, where nodes at the overlap are associated
with multiple communities. This especially tends to happen when relationship
of diﬀerent quality are projected in a one-mode network [47]. Ones’ social in-
teraction network for instance may consist of family members, work colleagues,
members of the same karate club or other associations. The more diverse interests
such a person has, the more diﬀerent communities this person will be assigned
into. In the same way, the more generic the nature of a technology fragment or
artifact, the more technological ﬁelds will it have functional relationships with.
Some technological artifacts (and the technology fragments resembling them) are
that pervasive, they facilitate almost all other technologies in the way they work,
such as by its time steam-power or nowadays semiconductors [14]. Embracing
that line of thought, researchers recently stated to develop community detec-
tion algorithms able to cope with overlapping and nested community structures
[48,49], which can be deployed to properly delimit interdependent technological
ﬁelds.

Identifying Technological Trajectories: Dynamic Community Detec-
tion. Technological ﬁelds do not spontaneously appear and reassemble in a
vacuum. They gradually change, grow or decline in an cumulative manner, fol-
lowing a historical technological trajectory which connects them over time. How-
ever, in times of disruptive technological change, former technology interaction
pattern might completely reconﬁgure, particular new conﬁgurations might spin-
oﬀ a main trajectory and so forth. Owing respect to the evolutionary nature
of technology, we want to identify communities which are somewhat stable and
thus to be found in multiple observation periods, but also allow technological
ﬁelds to experience disruptive key-events in their life-cycle. Besides helping us
linking changing communities over time, the identiﬁcation of such eﬀects in it-
self represents an interesting information. We consider the following signiﬁcant
events a community might experience during its evolution, also illustrated in
Figure 4:

– Birth & Death: The ﬁrst time a community Ct

i (which are the representation
of a technological ﬁeld ) is observed and not matched with an already existing
community Ct−1
. This community, however, does not have to be stable over
time. We in fact expect a substantial share of communities to only appear
in on period but not sustain.

j

– Pause: Communities might be more stable than the reporting on them in
the corpus.Thus, allowing them to pause for a period might smoothen birth
& death dynamics.

– Merge: In case two communities develop substantial functional interdepen-
dence, the main interaction with the rest of the system only happens be-
tween them. Thus they merge and form a new community consisting of both

Mapping the (R-)Evolution of Technological Fields

367

sets. Technically that happens when two or more diﬀerent communities are
matched with one dynamic community Dj in the previous period.

– Split: In the same manner, communities can also separate into independent
disciplines. Technically a split occurs when one community Ci matches with
two or more dynamic communities in the previous period.

We do so by applying a simple but eﬀective heuristic threshold-based method
allowing for many-to-many mappings between communities across diﬀerent ob-
servation periods proposed by [50]. Here we compare an identiﬁed community
Ct
i in observation period t with the set of dynamic communities in the previous

If the similarity exceeds the deﬁned matching threshold θ ∈ [0, 1], both com-
munities are added to the dynamic community Di. Using this has the advantage
that is independent of the (static) community detection method of choice in the
observation periods, hence represents a somewhat modular approach. It can also
handle overlapping as well as (with some minor adjustments) weighted communi-
ties. A major advantage of this approach is the separation of static and dynamic
community detection is the high ﬂexibility in the choice of suitable algorithms.

4 Demonstration Case

In the following section we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach to de-
liver insightful results, and provide some illustrative examples of measures and
graphical representations that can be used to gain further insights. We intended
to ﬁnd an empirical case of technological development that would combine a
large number of components from traditionally disconnected technological ﬁelds.
Additionally, the technology ﬁeld in focus should be yet in a formative stage and
have a potentially strong and broad social impact to generate enough attention
and thus reporting texts online. We decided to explore the ﬁeld of singularity.
Rather then a clearly delineated technological ﬁeld, singularity represents a fu-
ture scenario and an umbrella term that summarizes a number of developments
in areas as diverse as neuroscience and 3D printing. Based on the context of the
technology under study and the characteristics of the corpus, we provide exam-
ples how to calibrate the techniques used in the diﬀerent stages of or method
pipeline.

4.1 Empirical Setting: The Singularity Case

Technological Singularity as a term has gained momentum since the publication
of Ray Kurzweil’s book in 2005 [51]. Observing various measures of technological
progress over time, he argues that most technologies improved their performance

368

exponentially and therefore it is only a matter of a few decades until we will
have reached a point in history when artiﬁcial intelligence will supersede human
intelligence. The most powerful technological advancement of the 21th century
will happen when robotics, nanotechnology, genetic engineering and artiﬁcial
intelligence reach a certain level of development and can be combined, what will
have disruptive consequences for society, culture and the human nature.

Recently, singularity entered the European technology policy context, as a
technological ﬁeld within the Horizon 2020 programming. Since 2012, the Di-
rectorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG
CONNECT) is undertaking a foresight process to inform the ICT related pro-
gramming of research to be ﬁnanced under Horizon 2020, where singularity was
identiﬁed as one of the 10 central technological ﬁelds. It is currently being exam-
ined closer to capture early signals and anticipate beneﬁcial trends that should
be supported within public research funding schemes.

4.2 Data Mining and Corpus Generation

Researchers, organizations and science journalists are increasingly using social
media and the blogosphere to communicate ﬁndings and developments, far ahead
of journal publication or conference proceedings. This makes microblogging plat-
forms and in particular Twitter with over 200 million monthly active users (Feb.
2014) a valuable source of data. We now describe our data mining approach
aiming at selecting relevant twitter updates by relevant users. Instead of us-
ing already available corpora to study technological change in singularity, such
as patent description, scientiﬁc publications and industry journals, we choose
to create an own out of a variety of online available technology relevant text
documents, including publications, tech-blogs et cetera. Since singularity is a
recent and very heterogeneous movement spanning various scientiﬁc, industries
and tech-communities with distinct routines for communicating and publishing
ﬁndings and progress, our ﬁnal corpus therefore is supposed to be unbiassed
towards a particular discipline.

To identify relevant documents, we employ a socially-enhanced search rou-
tine based on twitter tweets. Twitter’s graph structure, built on followship links,
is similar to citation networks in academic publications. This enables the con-
struction of large directed graphs and allows applying network analysis methods,
to identify central actors for a particular ﬁeld or topic. For this study we con-
structed a large followship graph around the - somewhat arbitrarily selected
- account Singularity Hub, which is an online news platform that actively re-
ports on the topic. The initial snowballed network has 49,574 accounts. Using
eigenvector centrality, we identify the most inﬂuential users and then manually
reduce the number of nodes down to 34 twitter accounts that indicate an inter-
est for the area in their proﬁle.5 Figure 6 shows a central fragment of the network.

5 This selection is very restrictive but is likely to make the ﬁnal corpus less noisy.
Alternatively the manual reduction can be skipped and a corpus ﬁltering built in,
at a later stage.

Mapping the (R-)Evolution of Technological Fields

Coloring represents communities, detected by the Louvain algorithm [53], merely
for illustration. We can see that the red cluster seems to contain all the central
organisations that are present on twitter and focused on singularity and tran-
shumanism like the H+ movement, KurzweilAI, David Orban and more. The
green cluster is mostly populated with users that are related to robotics and the
violet to software architecture. An overview of the selected user accounts can be
found in Table 1.

Micro-blogged tweets (status updates) by these actors often contain links to
research papers, popular media articles or blog entries that the selected user
considers as worth communicating. For each of these accounts we extract up to
3,200 status updates starting with the most recent, 63,000 in total. We discard
all updates that do not carry a link. Relevant tweets were then identiﬁed using
a vector space model powered semantic search. The text content behind the
embedded links - outside of Twitter is then extracted and processed, and ﬁnally
represents our document corpus for further analysis.

4.3 Identiﬁcation of Technology Fragments: Entity Extraction

The documents in our corpus discuss technology from very diﬀerent angles. Some
talk about state-of-the art research in certain university labs, while others re-
view the allocation of public research grants or venture capital investment strate-
gies. When attempting to uncover functional relationships between technology
fragments, it is crucial to avoid false positives caused by relationships that are
non-technical in nature, such as being funded by the same investor, or developed
in the same country. We rely on entity extraction when condensing documents
to BOW representations. In the particular case we use OpenCalais, a free web
service that performs entity identiﬁcation across 39 diﬀerent concepts within
submitted text data. The great advantage of cloudsourcing in this case is given
by the fact that the centralized machine learning algorithms of OpenCalais are
trained on a very large amount of natural text and its dictionaries are constantly
updated and optimized. An oﬄine solution would hardly be able to compete in
terms of performance and topicality.6 When inspecting the results we ﬁnd clear
technology terms such as dna proﬁling, robotic surgical systems, clinical genomics
or regenerative stem cell technologies, which come fairly close to how we under-
stand technology fragments. These terms narrowly describe technology deployed
for a fairly delimited task. However, we also ﬁnd boarder technology terms such
as stem cells genomics, which span across a somewhat larger ﬁeld of applications
and are likely to include some of the aforementioned terms, and on an even more
generic level terms such as biotechnology or robot.While this clearly diverts from
our theoretical framework, where we ﬁnd on node level only functional interac-

6 For an overview and performance evaluation of available systems see [52]. In addition,
OpenCalais provides ontology reconciliation and disambiguation. Identiﬁed entities
are in many cases enriched with metadata (e.g. profession for persons, ticker symbols
for companies and geospatial coordinates for locations). Other detected entity types
are not used in this analysis.

tion of atomic technology fragments, we do not consider that as worrisome for
the analysis to come.

4.4 Network Generation, Technological Field and Trajectory

Identiﬁcation

For a very ﬁrst inspection and illustration of the nodeset we create a simple static
network of all documents connected by their similarity in terms of containing
technology fragments, cluster them by applying the common Louvain algorithm
[53], and plot them in Figure 7. For the three main communities detected we pro-
vide a tag-cloud, weighted by the fragments’ TF-IDF scores. One can see at ﬁrst
glance that our singularity corpus very broadly consists of three ﬁelds, where
the biggest is centered around robotics, and the two others around (stem) cell
and brain research, or to be more interpretative: Robotics, biotechnology and
neuroscience. Table 2 provides some key statistics on the networks, communities,
and their development. While subject to some ﬂuctuation, the networks seem to
develop from many to less nodes and edges, and to less but denser communities.
This might indicate singularity after an initial phase of experimentation to ma-
ture and establish more delimited ﬁelds and sub-disciplines, as life-cycle theories
might suggest.

We now construct a set of two-mode networks between this nodes and the
documents in our corpus,7 containing only documents published in the corre-
sponding observation period, which we choose to be half a year.8 Finally, we
project this structures on one-mode networks between technology fragments.

Now we identify technological ﬁelds with the link community detection algo-
rithm proposed by [48], which is able to detect communities with highly pervasive
overlap by clustering links between the nodes rather than the nodes themselves.9
Each node here inherits all memberships of its links and can thus belong to mul-
tiple, overlapping communities (technological ﬁelds). By doing so, we owe respect
to the overlapping and nested structure of technology, and are able to identify
key technological fragments interacting with multiple distinct ﬁelds.We ﬁrst run
the community detection separated for every time step independently. We do not
a-priori deﬁne a ﬁxed amount of communities, but rather set the cutoﬀ at the
point where the average community density is optimized in every observation
period.

Table 3 plots the network of knowledge fragments and their membership to tech-
nological ﬁelds for every timestep. Again, what can be seen is that singularity

using LSI and a 400 dimensional model as suggested by [55].

8 This choice has to be made according to the properties of the data to be analyzed,
since best results can be achieved when the network structure shows some gradual
change between the observation periods, but no radical turnover suggestion complete
discontinuity. This corresponds roughly to a Jaccard index of the two networks
between 0.2 and 0.8.

appears to develop from a broad area without clear boundaries and high inter-
connectedness towards clearly delimited technological ﬁelds. However, we also ﬁnd
ﬁrst hints that over time some very generic technologies such as smartphones and
artiﬁcial intelligence appear to develop towards a very central position, where they
serve as common interface between most other ﬁelds. While it seems unlikely that
smartphones (as we understand them today) will be around for much longer then a
decade, their centrality in the singularity discussion can be understood as the im-
portance of mobile devices that enhance our by nature limited interaction range.
In fact, smartphones became a rapidly adopted human enhancement device and
currently a number of diﬀerent wearable technologies are entering the mainstream
markets. We also see the generic artiﬁcial intelligence, which is at the very core of
the singularity debate, in a very central position as interface or generic technology
between technological.

We now perform a threshold-based dynamic community detection10, where we
besides an immense turnover of brieﬂy appearing and disseminating short-term
trends indeed ﬁnd identify a set of persistent technological trajectories. Table 4
illustrates the composition of some selected communities which proves to be
somewhat stable over time.11 The tag-cluster are a good way to visualize the in-
teraction between the actual technologies, principal applications and challenges.
The ﬁrst cluster suggests for instance that an important area of application
for biometric technologies in conjuncture with machine learning will be found
within law enforcement. The second cluster addresses advancements in the area
of augmented reality and connections to existent social network structures using
primarily mobile devices.

5 Summary and Conclusion

The aim of this paper was to provide a framework and novel methodology geared
towards mapping technological change in complex interdependent systems by
using large amounts of unstructured data from various recent on- and oﬄine
sources. We combine techniques from the ﬁelds of NLP and network analysis.
Our approach is based on the following steps:

– Using entity recognition techniques we identify technology related terms in

the text document of our corpus, which resemble technology fragments.

– In a ﬁrst step, using vector space modeling, we construct an undirected
two-mode network between technology fragments and corpus documents for
every observation period, where the edges are weighted by the pairwise cosine
similarities between documents and terms.

– After projecting this network in technology space, we end up with an undi-
rected one-mode network of technology fragments connected by their weighted
co-occurrence in documents of the corresponding observation period.

10 We use a C++ implementation provided by [50].
11 For the sake of clarity, the technology fragments are weighted by their within-cluster

centrality.

– To delimit technological ﬁelds in every observation period, we use overlapping
community detection techniques, owing respect to the interdependent and
nested nature of technology.

– To identify technological trajectories, we link technological ﬁelds between

observation periods over time using

As empirical example we use the broad area of Technological Singularity, an
umbrella term for diﬀerent technologies ranging from neuroscience to machine
learning and bioengineering which are seen as main contributors to the develop-
ment of artiﬁcial intelligence and human enhancement technologies. We extract
1,398 relevant text documents all over the internet, using a social search routine
that we built around the followship structure within the microblogging service
twitter. Using entity recognition tools from the semantic web area, we reduce
documents to technology-term representations and ﬁnally generate a semantic
timestep network of technology fragments. Our community detection exercise
identiﬁed many coherent technological ﬁelds within each community. Already
the static clustering provides valuable insights in the emergence of new techno-
logical ﬁelds and applications for existing technologies. Overlapping community
detection, allowed us also to identify certain general technologies that work as
hubs between other technologies, stemming from a large number of diﬀerent
domains.

Yet, we ﬁnd the results of the community-tracking over time unsatisfactory.
The obstacle are false negatives that obstruct the identiﬁcation of similar com-
munities over time. Our language is full of synonyms, metaphors and unregulated
terminology. The reader of this article has no diﬃculty comprehending that we
use the terms clusters and communities interchangeably, a computer would not.
While we are (yet) unable to teach the algorithm a deep understanding of on-
tology, we can try to normalize the terminology as far as possible. This future
measure should increase the number of identical terms over time. Furthermore,
there seem to be a trade-oﬀ between the thematic scope of a given corpus and
the resolution of the analysis. Therefore, a broader corpus is most suitable for
creating a broad-brush picture of technological change.

We believe a major advantage of our approach is that it conveys text data
into a network representation suitable for a dynamic analysis of technology. It
proves to be more ﬂexible with respect to the corpus than other semantic or
n-gram based methods in natural language processing. Furthermore, for subse-
quent quantitative analysis and graphical representation one can now draw from
the large toolkit of powerful methods available for network analysis. The here
performed dynamic community detection is one example, but other methods
such as blockmodeling appear to be promising to gain further insights into the
evolution of technology. Finally, networks are well established in many areas of
social science and thus a representation of semantic features as networks is likely
to help bridging the gap between scholars in computer and social science.
