Abstract. Mining user interests and preference plays an important role for many 
applications such as information retrieval and recommender systems. This pa-
per intends to study how to infer interests for new users and inactive users from 
social media. Although some recently proposed methods can mine user interests 
efficiently,  these  works  cannot make  full  use  of  relationship between  users  in 
their social network. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to infer inter-
ests of new users or inactive users based on social connections between users. A 
random-walk based mutual reinforcement model combining both text and link 
information  is  developed  in  the  approach.  More  importantly,  we  compare  the 
contribution of different social connections such as “follow”, “retweet”, “men-
tion”, and “comment” to interest sharing. Experiments conducted on real data-
set show that our method is effective and outperforms existing algorithms, and 
different social connections have different impacts on mining user interests.

Introduction 

With  the  advance  of  web  technology,  many  micro-blogging  websites  are  emerging 
rapidly. This kind of websites allows users not only to publish their views but also to 
share interests online. Twitter is one of the most famous micro-blogging services [14, 
15], while in China Tencent Weibo is one of the largest micro-blogging websites, and 
it provides the similar social-networking functionality with Twitter. 

A  user  registered  in  Tencent  provides  his  profile  information  such  as  gender  and 
date of birth, and publishes messages from time to time. Different people have differ-
ent publishing frequency. Some are very active and some are very inactive. Besides, 
unlike  other  social  network  services  that  require  users  to  send  a  request  to  make 
friends,  another  important  part  is  that  every  user  is  allowed  to  “follow”  the  others 
without seeking any permission. In this case, the  user  who initiated this behavior is 
called “follower”, while the one who is followed is called “friend”. After a “follow”

relationship  is  built,  follower  can  read  the  messages  published  by  his  friends.  Fur-
thermore, follower can retweet a message or leave a comment to it if he or she is in-
terested in the content. Unlike users registered in Twitter, users in Tencent can append 
some words when he retweets the message from others. Besides, a user is allowed to 
mention someone else when he publishes a message. To infer user interests, we use 
all  of  the  above-mentioned  information.  For  convenience,  we  call  user’s  profile  in-
formation  and  messages  posted  text  information  and  social  connection  relationships 
regarding follow, retweet, comment and mention link information. 

As  we  know,  the  number  of  micro-blogging  users  increased  rapidly.  A  statistic 
from a  newspaper shows that, the number of Tencent Weibo users has reached 310 
million and the number of active users has reached 50 million up to November 2011. 
Furthermore, each day there are thousands of enthusiastic new users adding into the 
existing  billions  of  actively  engaged  users.  Although  the  large  number  of  Tencent 
Weibo users benefit each other by information sharing, too much information results 
in information overload problem, which needs systems such as searching and recom-
mender system to solve. Thus, it’s really important to capture user interests and then 
provide  personalized  results  and  meet  user’s  needs  individually  according  to  one’s 
interests. 

There are many good ways [1, 2, 3] to infer user’s interests, however, most of them 
are not proposed for the social network. In these approaches user interest models are 
built according to the behavior history during web search, such as click-through web 
pages. For users in social network, the mainly behaviors are communication with the 
other users. Based on this difference, recently there are some  methods proposed for 
social network. These algorithms mine user’s interests through user contents such as 
micro-blog  messages  and  user-generated  tags.  However,  in  social  network  there  are 
some  users  preferring  to  read  messages  from  other  active  users  rather  than  publish 
some information about themselves. In this case, user-generated tags are not always 
representative of all of his interests, and only a small part of users provide tags. Espe-
cially  for  a  user  who  just  registered  or  the  user  who  is  not  very  active,  both  user-
generated tags and micro-blog messages are difficult to get. Another kind of existing 
works inferred user interests  from social  neighbors to solve the problem of inactive 
users. However, this solution focuses on the three-degree ego network of a user and 
uses  the  information  in  a  deterministic  way.  After  inferring  interests  for  one  target 
user, its interests will not affect the target user’s neighbors, which is unreasonable. In 
this paper, we emphasize mutual reinforcement between users through a process simi-
lar to random walk [16, 18]. 

Our proposed method is based on the homophily in social network. The phenome-
non of homophily means that individuals with similar characteristics tend to associate 
with each other. Although homophily has been validated in different social networks 
such as twitter and student homepages [13, 17, 19], it isn’t studied deeply in Tencent 
Weibo. As Tencent Weibo is mainly for Chinese users, and the culture and some in-
formation  sharing  mechanisms  are  different,  it  is  necessary  to  study  which  kind  of 
social connections reflect homophily and which one contributes more to interest shar-
ing. To do this, before developing the interest inferring method, we conducted some 
statistical tests to study the relationship between social connections and similarity of

user interests (Detail is explained in Section 3.1). Existing work has studied semantics 
of the follow and retweet relationship in twitter [20]. In this paper, we studied more 
relationships such as comment, besides follow, retweet and mention. 

According  to  this  study,  a  conclusion  that  users  with  communication  behaviors 
share more interests than those without can be made. Based on this finding, we pro-
pose a novel approach to infer user interests and we develop an algorithm to imple-
ment the approach. In this algorithm, first a directed graph to indicate potential inter-
est propagation among users is constructed. And then text information is used to gen-
erate  initial  interests  and  link  information  is  utilized  to  show  how  users  affect  each 
other  in  interests.  Then,  a  mutual  reinforcement  process  based  on  a  random  walk 
model is conducted to infer interests for new users and inactive users.   

Our work offers two contributions.   
First,  we  studied  the  relationship  between  social  connections  such  as  follow,  ret-
weet,  comment  and  mention  and  common  interests  between  users.  Statistical  study 
shows that different social behaviors have different influence on the interest similarity 
between  users.    We find that follow and retweet  mean  more strong connections  for 
users in common interests than mention and comment. 

Second, we propose a novel approach combining users’ text information and link 
information (information about social connection) to infer interests for inactive users. 
In this approach, the mutual reinforcement between users is emphasized by a random 
walk model. Experiments show that this approach can improve the accuracy by up to 
21.4%. Especially  for  inactive  users,  this  approach  can  address  the  shortcomings  of 
too little information. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2,  problem  definition   
is  given.  The  proposed  algorithm  is  introduced  in  section  3.  Experiment  setup  and 
results are described in section 4. In section 5, related work is discussed. Finally, con-
clusions are drawn in section 6.

Problem Definition 

Let U be the set of users registered in a social media website such as Tencent WeiBo. 
Each user has a unique ID assigned by the system. In this paper, interest is defined as 
a pair of keyword and its weight about this keyword. For active users, keywords can 
be extracted from the text information of the user. Weight shows the favorite degree 
of the user to this keyword. The larger the weight is, the more the user likes the inter-
est. One user can have one or more interests. Thus, a vector of pairs of keyword and 
weight is used to express the interests of users as shown in the definition below: 

Definition  1. The interests of a user are expressed by a set of pairs of keyword and 
weight. 

{keyword1:weight1; keyword2:weight2; … …; keywordl: weightl} 

Example of interest information is shown in Table 1, where each integer represents a 
keyword, followed by weight. Further, the interests of a user a can be expressed by a 
vector  Ia=<weight1,  weight2, …,  weightN>,  where  N is the  size of the union of all of 
user’s interest keywords.

The other kind of information is the link information between every pair of users. 
For users registered in Tencent Weibo, the basic behavior  information between two 
users is the “follow” relationship. Besides, there are several other behaviors between 
two users, including “retweet (publishing other user’s message)”, “mention (mention-
ing  other  users  when  publish  a  message)”,  “comment  (having  a  comment  on  other 
user’s message)” and so on. These behaviors create links between users, which will be 
introduced  in  details  in  the  next  section.  The  follow  relationship  information  is 
showed in Table 2. And the other behavior information, such as “retweet”, “mention” 
and “comment” is given in Table 3, which shows the numbers of times of these dif-
ferent behaviors happened from user a to user b. 

According  to  link  information,  a  directed  behavior  graph  G(V,  E)  can  be  con-
structed to show the relationships among users. V is the node set which contains all 
the  registered  users.  E  is  the  edge  set.  Suppose  a  and  b  are  two  registered  users.  If 
user a has any action of follow, retweet, mention and comment to user b, an edge (a, 
b) is formed from user a to user b. 

After constructing behavior graph G(V, E), a directed graph G′(V, E′) called propa-
gation graph is constructed to model how user interest propagates, in which a node is 
also  on  behalf  of  a  user  registered  in  the  website.  V  is  the  same  node  set  as  that  in 
graph G, and each edge (b, a) in E′ corresponds to edge (a, b) in E. That is, if user a 
initiated  an  action  such  as  “follow”,  “retweet”,  “comment”  or  “mention”  to  user  b, 
there is an edge from the node b to node a. The direction of the edge is exactly oppo-
site to the one in E. Because when an action is initiated from user a to user b, it re-
veals  that  user  b’s  interests  attract  user  a,  and  user  b  has  some  influence  on  user  a 
about his interests. Thus, the interests should propagate from user b to user a. Besides, 
there is a weight assigned to this edge to indicate the influence on interests user b has 
on user a. And also an interest vector is assigned to each node according to the text 
information of users. However, first, not every user has this value, because some new 
registered users have little information published. And second, it’s not easy to collect 
the  interest  information  for  every  user  especially  for  those  inactive  users  who  have 
little information. Thus, our mining task is to infer interests for these users in the net-
work.

Interest Inferring Method 

3.1  Hypothesis Tests 

To  infer  user  interests  from  his  link  relationship,  several  questions  need  to  be  ans-
wered to prove whether this approach is valid. 
Questions  1,  2,  3  and  4:  Do users with “follower-friend”, “retweet”, “comment” or 
“mention” relationships in micro-blogging system in China have more similar inter-
ests than those without? 

Besides these four questions directly related to the four kinds of    link information 
we mentioned before, another factor indirectly related to the “follow” relationship is 
analyzed, that is the ratio of common friends of two users. In the next sections, this 
information is also discussed with the link information. Thus, another similar question 
is raised. 
Question  5:  Do  users  who  have  more  common  friends  in  Chinese  micro-blogging 
system have more similar interests than those without? 

To answer these questions, we give the definition of interest similarity of two users 

as follows: 
Definition 2. Interest similarity of two users a and b can be measured by Equation 1.

)

va  and  vb  are  interest  vectors  of  user  a  and  b  respectively,  extracted  from  their  text 
information. 

Question 1 can be formalized as a two-sample t-test. Let ufollow be the mean interest 
similarity of the pairs of users  with  “follower-friend” relationship,  while  unofollow  the 
mean interest similarity of the pairs of users without. Let H0 be the null hypothesis: 
ufollow=unofollow, and H1 be the alternative hypothesis: ufollow>unofollow. Results show the 
null  hypothesis  is  rejected  at  significant  level  α  =0.01  with  a  p-value  of  3.14×10-5. 
Question 2, 3, 4 and 5 are formalized as a two-sample t-test separately, too. Results 
show that the answers of Question 2, 3, and 4 are positive, and the null hypothesis is 
rejected  at  significant  level  α  =  0.05.  To  conduct  a  hypothesis  test  on  Question  5, 
Equation 2 is used to measure the ratio of the common friends between two users.

Fa and Fb are the friend sets of user a and b separately. When selecting users who are 
used  in  hypothesis  test,  the  users  whose  “common  friends”  measurement  are  larger 
than 0.8 are selected. Result shows that the null hypothesis is rejected at significant 
level α = 0.05 with a p-value of 2×10-3. 

From  these  tests,  we  know  that  all  the  answers  to  these  questions  are  positive, 
which shows that users who have these behaviors (follow, retweet, comment, mention 
and common friends) are more similar than users who don’t. Based on this outcome, a 
novel approach to infer user interests is proposed in the next part. 

3.2  Random Walk Based Inference Model 

In this section, we focus on the problem of how to infer user interests after we con-
struct the propagation graph. We will explain how to construct the graph later.

Fig. 3. One user and his in-
degree neighbors   

 

For one user in  the  social  network, its local directed  graph is shown in Fig. 1 to 

show its follow relationship. 

And the directed graph to show its influence relationship in interests is shown in 
Fig. 2, right opposite to the direction in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, user a follows user d, e, and 
f, and also is followed by user b and c. In Fig. 2, the direction of interest propagation 
is  right  opposite.  Interests  are  propagated  from  user  d,  e,  f  to  user  a,  while  user  a 
propagates interests to user b and c.   

From Fig. 2, the interests of user a can be collected from two aspects. One is the 
text information of user a. For a user who has published some messages, an interest 
vector  can  extracted  from  the  messages  he  published,  retweeted  or  commented.  On 
the other hand, based on the finding in the previous section, some information sharing 
behaviors indicate the common interests between users. Thus, interest information can 
also be inferred from those users who have link relationship with them. The interests 
are propagated to the user in a certain probability, which is expressed by weight of the 
corresponding in-degree edge. We denote this probability by wij on edge (uj, ui). For 
example, the probability of the interests propagating from user d to user a is denoted 
as wad, as shown in Fig. 3. Combining the two resources of information, for user a, his 
interests according to this method is inferred by Equation 3.

In Equation 3, U is the set of all users in the network, va is the interest vector of user a 
extracted from the text information, and    Ia is user a’s overall interest vector consi-
dering both text and link information, and α
 is the decaying factor of influence from 
user’s in-degree neighbors. The lower α    is, the less influence a user will be got from 
his friends, and vice versa. 

According to this formula, the interests can be computed recursively, because users 
influence each other during the information sharing behaviors. Thus, a random walk 
process is utilized to implement the mutual reinforcement between users. 

Suppose the whole propagation matrix is denoted as P. P is a |U|×|U| matrix, where 
each entry is equal to wij, as we described above.    All users’ interest vectors are col-
lected into a |U|×N matrix, v, where N is the total number of keywords. Each row vi of 
the matrix v is the interest vector extracted from text information of user i. Then the 
interests of all users in network can be computed.   

The interest matrix of the users, denoted as I, where row j represents user j’s inter-
est vector. Matrix I can be calculated iteratively by Equation 4. It is a |U|×N matrix 
and represents the interests after t times of iterations, t > 0. Initially, I0 = v.

According to the property of Markov chain, convergence is guaranteed if P is stochas-
tic. In the next sections, we introduce how to compute the weight of the propagation 
graph and make sure that P satisfies this requirement. 

3.3  Generating Interest Vector from Text Information 

There  are  several  methods  to  produce  initial  interest  vectors  for  users.  Usually,  user-
generated  tags  can  be  considered  as  a  way  to  express  user  interests.  However,  most 
people add few tags in the system, thus other information, such as messages one posted, 
can be utilized. All tweets posted by one user can be collected as a document for the 
user.  These  tweets  include  not  only  the  tweets  and  comments  published  by  the  user 
himself and also those retweeted from others. And for all users in the website, a set of 
documents can be collected and used. In this paper, a typical method, Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation (LDA) [5, 12] model is applied to these documents, which is an unsupervised 
machine learning technique to identify latent topic from large document collection.   

3.4  Assigning Weights to Edges 

In  the  social  media  websites  like  Tencent  Weibo  micro-blogging  system,  users  can 
communicate with each other by retweet, comment and mention behaviors. According 
to  these  different  communications,  five  different  factors  are  defined  to  compute  the 
weight of edge (b, a) in propagation graph. 

Based on Retweet 
We measure the influence of user b to user a based on the amount of user b’s tweets 
retweeted by user a. The more tweets retweeted by user a, the more influence user b 
has to user a, and the more common interests occurs between user a and user b. Let 
RTab be the number of tweet retweeted by user a from user b. The weight is measured 
by Equation 5.

Based on Comment 
The  number  of  comments  which  user  a  gives  to  user  b  measures  the  degree  user  a 
shows interests on the tweets of user b. Let CMab be the number of comments user a 
gives to user b. Then the weight of the edge from user b to user a is calculated like by 
Equation 6.

Based on Mention 
Mention  action  is  another  communications  between  two  users.  To  some  extent,  the 
frequency of this action can show the influence user b has to user a. let MEab be the 
number of “mention” actions user a gives to user b, then we measure the weight ac-
cording to Equation 7.

T. Wang et al. 

Based on Follow Relationship 
The  “follow”  relationship  is  the  basis  and  most  usual  action  in  the  social  network. 
Mostly, user a will follow user b if he is interested in the tweets posted by user b or 
user b himself. Thus, this kind of relationship can reflect the relationship between two 
users and their interests. fab is used to show whether user a follow user b. According 
to this, the weight of the edge from user b to user a is measured by Equation 8, where   
fab=1 if user a follows user b, otherwise, fab=0.

Based on Intersection of Friends 
According to the “follow” relationships of one user, a list of his friends can be got. 
For user a and user b, the larger the set of intersection of their friends, the more inter-
ests  they  share.  Let  Fa  be  the  set  of  the  friends  of  user  a,  and  Fb  be  the  set  of  the 
friends of user b. Then the influence user b has on user a can be calculated according 
to this Equation 2. And then the weight on the edge (b, a) in the propagation graph is 
measured by Equation 9.

Considering this will generate a matrix with so many non-zero numbers, we neglect 
those values which are smaller than 0.1. Through this process, the non-zero values are 
reduced  to  422380,  which  makes  the  matrix  sparse  and  improves  the  efficiency  of 
iteration.   

If the denominators in Equations 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 are zeros, 1/|U| is used to replace the 
formula. Combining these five factors, a comprehensive computation formula is pro-
posed in Equation    10.

After these factors are defined, the propagation matrix on interests can be identified. 
From these computation formulas, each row in the propagation matrix is sum up to 1, 
which makes the propagation matrix stochastic. This makes sure the iteration process 
will converge.

Experiment   

4.1  Dataset 

A large dataset collected from Tencent weibo is provided by the Tencent Company. 
To test the proposed method, a relatively small network is extracted by a BFS algo-
rithm. After this extraction process, the total number of users in U is 5238. For every 
pair of users in U, the corresponding information is also extracted, including the fol-
low relationship, the number of “retweet”, “comment”, and “mention” actions. Table 
4 shows some information of this dataset U. The distribution of the followers for each 
user is shown in Fig. 4.

Basically, this distribution of followers per user follows a power-law distribution 
approximately.  That  is,  most  people  have  small  number  of  followers,  while  only  a 
small  of  users  have  a  large  number  of  followers,  which  proves  that  the  experiment 
data extracted is reasonable and representative.

Fig. 4. Distribution of followers per user

For  each  user  in  the  network,  keywords  information  is  extracted  from  messages 
posted. The number of distinct keywords for all 5238 users is 22376, and the average 
number  of  keywords  which  one  user  has  is  29.  A  five-fold  cross  validation  is  con-
ducted  in  this  paper.  We  split  these  5238  interest  vectors  into  five  parts.  For  every 
time,  four  parts  of  the  vectors  are  used  as  training  set,  and  the  rest  one  is  test  set, 
whose interest vectors are regarded as truth. In the experiment, the text information of 
users in training set and the link information of users both in training set and test set 
are utilized to infer interests for users in test set. 

4.2 

Performance Comparison 

We conduct experiments based on five different behavior factors, “retweet”, “mention”, 
“comment”,  “follow”  and  “common  friends”.  Correspondingly,  we  denote  these  me-
thods  as  “RT”,  “ME”,  “CM”,  “Follow”  and  “Common  Friends  (or  CF)”.  In  the  next 
tables,  these  abbreviations  will  be  used  to  show  the  comparisons.  For  each  factor,  a 
separate experiment is conducted to compare which factor performs better. To combine 
all of these factors, five weights need to be determined. We extract a part of data from 
training  set  and  compute  five  NDCG  values  according  to  different  factors  separately. 
Based on the NDCG values, we set the five weights. The larger the NDCG value is, the 
larger the weight of the factor. In this paper, we set these weights, wrt, wcm, wme, wf, and 
    as  0.31,  0.25,  0.25,  0.32,  and  0.34  respectively.  The  method  combining  the  five 
wcf
factors  is  called  “combination”.  When  determining  whether  to  stop  the  iterations,  the 
sum of absolute errors of each entry of the result matrix is used. In our experiment, this 
value is set to 0.1. When the sum of the absolute errors is smaller than 0.1, the iterations 
will stop and the method get final results for each user in the test set. 

Comparison against related algorithm is also conducted. The work in [4] is one of 
the classic related works in inferring interests. In this paper, user interests are inferred 
from his social connections, that is, his friends, friends’ friends and 3-degree friends. 
This  method  is  called  “3D-Friends”  here.  For  each  user,  a  3-degree  ego  network  is 
constructed  to  infer  the  interests  for  inactive  users.  These  results  are  compared  in 
Table 5.

From Table 5  we observe that the factor of common  friends has  more significant 
impact  than  the  other  four  factors.  The  method  based  on  follow  relationship  also 
works better, with NDCG only less than the one based on common friends. However, 
the  methods  based  on  “comment”  and  “mention”  don’t  work  very  well.  The  reason 
why the performance of these two methods is not very well will be studied later. Be-
sides, the method based on five comprehensive factors outperforms all the other me-
thods.  Our  best  method  increases  the  quality  of  interest  inferring  than  the  existing 
method, 3D-Friends, by 21.4%. 

The  number  of  edges  of  the  propagation  graph  based  on  each  factor  is  shown  in 
Table 6. For a graph that has 5238 nodes, the total number of edges of complete graph 
is  5238×5238=27436644. When  the  factor  of  “Common  Friends”  is  considered,  the 
graph is complete with a large number of edges. We reduce the number of edge con-
structed based on “Common Friends” to improve the efficiency. If the weights com-
puted based on “Common Friends” factor is smaller than 0.1, the corresponding edge 
is removed. Through this process, the non-zero values in the propagation matrix are 
reduced to 422380, which make the matrix sparse and improve the efficiency of com-
putation. Accordingly, the number of edges of the “Combination” method is not very 
large, too. After this edge removal step, the number of edges is reduced to 511676, 
which makes the propagation matrix sparse, too. For the other four factors, the num-
ber  of  edges  is  small,  especially  for  the  factors  of  “comment”  and  “mention”.  The 
propagation  matrix  based  on  “retweet”  or  “follow”  has  more  non-zero  values  than 
those based on “comment” and “mention”. This tells us that users prefer to follow the 
others and retweet the tweets more than comment or mention others. Basically, based 
on the comparison  we can conclude that different  user behaviors have different im-
pact on user interests, which is same with the conclusion with Adamic and Adar [19], 
that is, some factors are better indicators of social connections than others. 

We  also  compare  the  efficiency  of  our  method  with  3D-Friends,  which  is  illu-
strated in Fig. 5. From this Figure, we know that the time spent is proportional to the 
number of the non-zero values in the propagation matrix. The efficiency of our me-
thod  based  on  mention,  comment,  retweet  or  follow  is  better  than  the  method  3D-
Friends. Time spent on common friend graph and the combination graph is more than 
3D-Friends,  because  these  two  graphs  are  much  denser  than  the  graph  3D-Friends 
uses.

4.3  Effect of Decay Factor 
In this experiments described in the last section, we set the decaying factor α
 to 0.5. 
However, this decaying factor determines the important degree of the influence from 
a user’s friends. The result of the algorithm will differ according to different decaying 
factor. Fig. 6 shows the changes of the results NDCG of all our six algorithms based 
on different decaying factor values. 

 

 

Fig. 6. Effect of α to NDCG 

Fig. 7. Effect of α to number of iterations 
From Fig. 6 we can observe that in most scenarios NDCG gets the best when α

 is 
between 0.4 to 0.6. However, the changes caused by different decaying factors are not 
very significant. No matter what value the decaying factor is, the basic trend among 
the results of the five methods remains similar. 

The value of decaying factor has influence on not only the accuracy of the results, 
but also the efficiency of the algorithms. The number of iterations for different decay-
ing factors is shown in Fig. 7. The larger the number of iterations is, the more time the 
corresponding method spends. From Fig. 7 we can see that the growth trends follow 
an exponential distribution. In our experiment, the decaying factor α
 is set to 0.5, and 
the number of iterations is about 21. When α
 is larger than 0.6, the run time increases 
a lot, and neighbor’s influence becomes too heavy in the meantime.

Related Work 

In  this  section,  we  briefly  introduce  related  work.  We  category  related  work  about 
user interest study into three groups: 1) based on user contents 2) based on user beha-
vior 3) based on social cues. 

96

Based  on  User  Contents.  Simply,  explicit  interests  can  be  specified  directly  from 
users’ profiles. In addition, other sources can also indicate users’ interests. Some users 
prefer to use descriptive tags to express what they are interested in. Therefore, some 
researchers proposed approaches to find social interest based on user-generated tags 
[1, 9, 10].  However,  these  tags  are  not  always  representative,  and  some  users  don’t 
like  to  add  these  tags  to  themselves.  Although  the  tags  extracted  from  user  micro-
blogs can replace the user-generated tags, it still cannot work well for new users and 
inactive users who have few micro-blogs. 
Based  on  User  Behaviors.  Several  algorithms  have  been  proposed  based  on  user 
behaviors during web search and browsing. Interests are captured from click through 
data or visited  web pages [2, 6]. Qiu and  Cho [7] focus on disambiguating the true 
intention of a query based on past click history. Kim and Chan [8] proposed a divisive 
hierarchical clustering algorithm to learn a user interest hierarchy from a set of web 
pages.  These  methods  based  on  user  behaviors,  especially  based  on  click-through 
history and web pages are mainly used to personalize user interests in the web search 
community. However, for users in social network, the click history is too sparse to be 
utilized  to  infer  user  interests.  Most  of  users’  behaviors  are  to  share  the  messages 
from their friends. 
Based  on  Social  Cues.  All  of  these  above-mentioned  methods  use  user  individual 
information to infer interests. For the inactive users who have not many profiles and 
behaviors, these approaches cannot  work  well. Therefore, some researchers propose 
to infer user interests by leveraging social cues from other users. Similar with colla-
borative filtering systems, Glodberg et. al [3] proposed a method to mine the interests 
from the  users  who  have similar opinions on a set of items. Their basic idea is that 
users  who  have  similar  behaviors  will  share  similar  interests.  Similarly,  White  et.al 
[11] proposed a method to find a user’s interests from other users that visit the same 
page as the user. In addition, another new approach is proposed by Wen and Lin [4]. 
It focuses on social cues from user’s neighbors. In this work, for one target user, the 
neighbors in his three-degree ego network are considered. That is, for each user, a 3-
degree ego network is constructed to infer interests. Relationships between users are 
built based on electronic communication data such email and instant messaging and 
Web2.0  social  content  such  as  social  bookmarks  and  ﬁle  sharing.  The  interests  of 
active users in the network are extracted by LDA model from text information. Then 
inactive users’ interests are computed based on their neighbors in a deterministic way, 
without  considering  user’s  mutual  influence.  Besides,  Welch  et  al  [20]  demonstrate 
that in Twitter platform retweeting is a better indicator of topical interest than follow-
ing behavior through the PageRank algorithm. 

In our study, we focus on leveraging the social network to infer user interests. The 
contents from active users are considered as initial interests. These interests are prop-
agated through the social network, which is built according to the interest similarity 
between  users.  This  approach  has  important  differences  from  the  above-mentioned 
existing work in two aspects. First, unlike the existing methods based on user content 
and  behavior,  our  proposed  approach  works  well  especially  for  users  who  have  no 
text information. Second, different from the methods based on social cues, we consid-
er  the  social  connections  and  emphasize  the  mutual  reinforcement  among  users,  in-
stead of directly inferring from a couple of friends or similar users.

Conclusions and Future Work 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for user interests inferring especially for 
new users and inactive users who have few messages published. In this approach, a 
random  walk  on  a  propagation  graph  model  is  used  to  emphasize  the  mutual  rein-
forcement between users. When constructing the propagation graph, both text infor-
mation  and  link  information  of  users  are  taken  into  account.  Besides,  we  prove  by 
statistical tests that information sharing behaviors such as follow, retweet, comment 
and mention are related to the common interests between users. And the experimental 
results  conducted  on  real  social  network  data  set  show  that  different  kind  of  social 
connections have different influence to common interests. Experimental results dem-
onstrate that our methods get a better performance not only in the quality but also in 
efficiency. In the future, we will utilize the approach to provide better results for re-
commender system in social network.
