Abstract.  Drug  development  is  time-consuming,  costly,  and  risky.  Approx-
imate 80% to 90% of drug development projects fail before they ever get into 
clinical trials. To reduce the high risk of failure for drug development, pharma-
ceutical companies are exploring the drug repositioning approach for drug de-
velopment. Previous studies have shown the feasibility of using computational 
methods to help extract plausible drug repositioning candidates, but they all en-
countered  some  limitations.  In  this  study,  we  propose  a  novel  drug-
repositioning  discovery  method  that  takes  into  account  multiple  information 
sources, including more than 18,000,000 biomedical research articles and some 
existing  ontologies  that  cover  detailed  relations  between  drugs,  proteins  and 
diseases. We design two experiments to evaluate our proposed drug reposition-
ing discovery method. Overall, our evaluation results demonstrate the capability 
and superiority of our proposed drug repositioning method for discovering po-
tential, novel drug-disease relationships.

Introduction 

Drug development is time-consuming, costly, and risky. The development process to 
bring a new drug to market requires about 10-15 years and costs between 500 million 
and 2 billion U.S. dollars [1]. However, as the U.S. National Institutes of Health re-
ported, 80 to 90 percent of drug development projects fail before they ever get tested 
in  human  [2].  To  reduce  the  high  risk  of  failure  for  de  novo  drug  development,   
pharmaceutical  companies  have  been  evaluating  alternative  paradigms  for  drug  de-
velopment,  e.g.,  drug  repositioning.  The  goal  of  drug  repositioning  is  to  find  new 
indications  (i.e.,  treatment  for  diseases)  for  existing  drugs.  Because  existing  drugs 
already have their preclinical properties and established safety profiles, many experi-
ments, analyses and tests can therefore be bypassed [3]. Thus, drug repositioning can 
reduce significant time and cost in the discovering and preclinical  stage.  Moreover, 
drug  repositioning  helps  a  company  exploit  its  intellectual  property  portfolio  by   
extending its old or expiring patents, or getting new method-of-use patents [3]. 

One notable example of repositioned drug is Thalidomide. It was originally  mar-

keted  as  a  sedative  and  antiemetic  for  pregnant  women  to  treat  morning  sickness,

but was completely withdrawn from the market after the drug was found responsible 
for  severe  birth  defects  [4].  After  Celgene  Corporation’s  repositioning  works,  FDA 
approved  Thalidomide  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  Erythema  Nodosum  Leprosum 
(ENL) in 1998 [5]. The company further discovered that Thalidomide is also effective 
against  several  other  diseases,  including  multiple  myeloma.  Accordingly,  Celgene 
gets several utility patents for the repositioned Thalidomide, and it brings in over 300 
million U.S. dollars in revenue annually since 2004 [6-8]. 

Several computational drug repositioning approaches have been developed to help 
medical  researchers  sift  the  most  plausible  drug-disease  pairs  from  a  wide  range  of 
combinations. Dudley et al. [9] summarized several computational drug repositioning 
methods and categorized them as either drug-based, where discovery from the chemi-
cal or pharmaceutical perspective, or disease-based,  where  discovery  from the pers-
pective  of  disease  management,  symptomatology,  or  pathology.  Another  excellent 
review  in  [10]  highlights  computational  techniques  for  systematic  analysis  of  tran-
scriptomics, side effects and genetics data to generate new hypotheses for additional 
indications.  Several  network  based  approaches  use  various  heterogeneous  data  re-
sources  to  discovery  drug  repositioning  opportunity  [11,  12].  Moreover,  Wu  et  al. 
[13] summarized 26 different sources of databases related to disease, genes, proteins, 
and  drugs  for  drug  repositioning.  In  summary,  existing  drug-repositioning  methods 
can  broadly  be  classified  into  two  approaches:  literature-based  and  ontology-based. 
The literature-based approach assumes that if a drug frequently co-occurs with some 
biomedical concepts (such as enzymes, genes, pathological effects, and proteins) and 
many of these concepts also frequently co-occur with a disease in biomedical litera-
ture  (e.g.,  MEDLINE),  it is likely  that the disease is a new indication  for the focal 
drug  [14].  In  contrast,  the ontology-based approach  relies on existing ontologies (or 
knowledge bases) to discover hidden relationships between drugs and diseases. These 
existing  methods  have shown their feasibility for drug repositioning. However,  most 
existing methods rely only on single information source, i.e., literature or ontologies. 

In  this  study,  we  propose  a  drug  repositioning  method  that  exploits  multiple   

information sources to discover hidden relationships between drugs and diseases. Spe-
cifically, a comprehensive network of biomedical concepts is first constructed by com-
bining  and  integrating  relations  of  biomedical  concepts  extracted  from  literature  and 
existing  ontologies.  Subsequently,  we  follow  Swanson’s  ABC  model  [14]  to  obtain 
links between a focal drug (A) and intermediate terms (Bs) and then between Bs and 
diseases  (Cs)  from  the comprehensive concept  network.  A novel link  weighting  me-
thod and two target term ranking measures are proposed to effectively rank candidate 
diseases  that  are  likely  to  be  new  indications  of  the  focal  drug  A.  To  evaluate  the   
proposed method, we collect the literature from MEDLINE and three ontologies (i.e., 
DrugBank [15], Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [16], and Comparative 
Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [17]), and follow the evaluation procedure proposed 
in  [18]  to conduct a series of experiments.  According  to  our  empirical  evaluation  re-
sults, our proposed method outperforms the existing method for drug repositioning. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  reviews  existing   
methods  related  to  this  study,  and  discuss  their  limitations  to  justify  our  research

motivation. In Section 3, we describe the design of our proposed drug repositioning 
discovery  method.  Section  4  reports  on  our  evaluation  of  our  proposed  method.   
Finally, we conclude our study in Section 5.

Related Work 

In this section, we review existing drug repositioning methods, which can be classi-
fied into two major approaches: literature-based and ontology-based. 

2.1  Literature-Based Approach 

Swanson [19]  first introduced the idea of discovering hidden relationships from bio-
medical literatures in the mid-1980s.  He examined across disjoint literatures, manual-
ly identified plausible new connections, and found fish oil might be beneficial to the 
treatment of Raynaud’s syndrome [19]. Furthermore, Swanson and Smalheiser devel-
oped  a  computational  model,  namely  “ABC  model”  or  “undiscovered  public  know-
ledge (UPK) model” [14]. The basic assumption of ABC model is that if a biomedical 
concept  A  relates  to  intermediate  concept  B  and  intermediate  concept  B  relates  to 
another concept C, there is a logically plausible relation between A and C. The  ABC 
model generally consists of three major phases: term selection to extract textual terms 
(concepts) from the literature, link weighting to assess the link strength between two 
concepts, and  target  term  ranking to rank target terms by  assigning a  score to each 
target  term  on  the  basis  of  the  connections  and  link  weights  between  the  starting   
term  and  the  target  term.  This approach is often referred to  as the  literature-based 
discovery. 

Weeber et al. [20] followed Swanson’s idea of co-occurrence analysis and mapped 
words from titles and abstracts extracted from MEDLINE articles to Unified Medical 
Language System (UMLS) concepts to filter link candidates with the help of semantic 
information.  Similarly,  Wren  et  al.  [21]  mapped  full  text  from  articles  into  OMIM 
concepts. They measured link weights between concepts by mutual information. Lee 
et al. [22] further combined multiple thesauruses to better translate text into biomedi-
cal concepts. These studies employed the full text for concept extraction with the help 
of  thesauri.  On  the  other  hand,  some  other  studies  used  Medical  Subject  Headings 
(MeSH)  as  keywords  to  annotate  each  article  in  MEDLINE  [18]  [23-24].  They  ap-
plied tf-idf, association rule, and z-score as the measurement of link weights. All of 
them  reported  the  metadata-only  approach  is  feasible,  though  Hristovski  et  al.  [24] 
noted some shortcoming of using MeSH such as insufficient information of involving 
genes. Based on the ABC model, several drug repositioning methods [20-21] [25-26] 
were  proposed  to  find  undiscovered  relations  between  drugs  and  diseases  through 
selecting  different  semantic  groups  of  intermediate  terms  such  as  adverse  effects, 
genes, and proteins. 

For evaluating the performance of the  literature-based approach,  Yetisgen-Yildiz 
and  Pratt  [18]  developed  an  evaluation  methodology.  They  used  two  literature  sets 
collected  from  separated  time  spans,  and  trained  systems  by  using  the  older  set  to

predict novel relations in the newer set. They compared  the  effectiveness  of  various 
link weighting methods. According to their study, association rule appears to achieve 
the best performance over tf-idf, mutual information measure, and z-score. They also 
compared different target term ranking algorithms and suggested that  the  use  of  link 
term count with average minimum weight can achieve the best effectiveness. 

2.2  Ontology-Based Approach 

Campillos  et  al.  [27] constructed a network of side-effect driven drug-drug relations 
from UMLS ontology by  measuring  side-effect similarity  between drugs.  Assuming 
that similar side effects of  unrelated drugs  may be  caused  by common targets, they 
can  be  used  to  predict  new  drug-target  interactions.  They  also  experimentally  vali-
dated their results, and thus reported the feasibility of using phenotypic information to 
infer  unexpected  biomedical  relations.  Yang  and  Agarwal  [28]  also  based  on  side 
effect  likelihood  between  drugs,  but  they  constructed  Naïve  Bayes  models  to  make 
predictions. They took PharmGKB and SIDER knowledge bases, rather than pheno-
type database, as their information sources. Cheng et al. [29] built a bipartite network 
by  extracting  known  drug-target  interaction  data  from  DrugBank,  and  used  the  net-
work similarity to predict new targets of drugs. Li and Lu [30] built a network similar 
to Cheng et al.’s work, but added the similarity of drug chemical structure into con-
sideration. 

Qu et al.  [31] and Lee et al. [26] both attempted to increase the size and scope of 
semantic data by constructing integrated network or database of ontologies. However, 
to our best knowledge, few prior  studies,  if  any,  take  both ontologies and literature 
into  account,  which  may  be  a  good  way  to  acquire  deeper  and  broader  biomedical 
knowledge  for  making  predictions  of  drug-disease  relations.  Li  et  al.  [32]  tried  to 
incorporate  more  knowledge  by  using  protein-protein  interactions  extracted  from 
Online  Predicted  Human  Interaction  Database  (OPHID)  to  expand  disease-related 
proteins, and built disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps based on literature 
mining. His work inspires us to build a network over multiple information sources.

The Proposed Method 

We propose a drug repositioning discovery method that is based on Swanson’s ABC 
model [14] but takes both biomedical literature and existing ontologies into account. 
Fig.  1 illustrates  our proposed  method,  which consists of four main phases: compre-
hensive  concept  network  construction,  related  concept  retrieval,  link  weighting, and 
target term ranking. 

3.1 

Phase 1: Comprehensive Concept Network Construction 

The  goal  of  this  phase  is  to  construct  a  literature-based  concept  network  from  the 
biomedical literature and an ontology-based concept network from existing ontologies 
(i.e.,  DrugBank,  OMIM,  and  CTD  in  this  study)  and,  subsequently,  integrate  them 
into a comprehensive concept network.

For the literature-based concept network construction, we collect the biomedical li-
terature  from  MEDLINE  2011  baseline.  U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) 
indexes the publication type for each article. We follow Yetisgen-Yildiz’s preprocess-
ing  procedure  [18]  to  remove 18 irrelevant  types  (e.g.,  address,  bibliography,  com-
ment,  etc.)  from  the  61  publication  types  in  MEDLINE  2011  baseline.  NLM  also 
indexes  several  MeSH  terms  for  each  biomedical article.  As a result, our literature 
database consists of 18,712,338 biomedical articles.  The number of MeSH terms per 
article ranges from 1 to 97, and its average is 9.44.  We  further  select  several  MeSH 
subcategories  related  to  drug  repositioning,  as  shown  in  Table  1.  Next,  association 
rule mining is applied on the collected literature where biomedical articles and MeSH 
terms  are  considered  as  transactions  and  items,  respectively.  We  follow  Yetisgen-
Yildiz and Pratt’s experiment [18] by setting the  minimum support threshold to 2.6 
and  the  minimum  confidence  threshold  to  0.0055  in  this  study.  After  filtering,  we 
extract  12,278  MeSH  terms  and  2,623,222  relations  to  construct  a  literature-based 
concept network.

Fig. 1. Overall Process of the Proposed Drug Repositioning Discovery Method 

For  the  ontology-based  concept  network  construction,  the  ontologies  we  use  in   
this  study  include  DrugBank  [15],  OMIM  [16],  and  CTD  [17].  DrugBank 
(http://www.drugbank.ca/)  is  a  richly  annotated  database  which  provides  extensive 
information about targets, pathways, indications, adverse effects, and related proteins 
of  various  drugs,  whereas  OMIM  (http://www.omim.org/)  is  a  comprehensive  and

authoritative  knowledge  base  of  human  genes  and  genetic  phenotypes.  CTD 
(http://ctdbase.org/) is a database that integrates data from scientific literature to de-
scribe chemical interactions with genes and proteins, and diseases and genes/proteins, 
and  others.  The  collected  information  includes  various  types  of  relations,  such  as 
drug-target,  gene-disease,  gene-gene,  protein-protein,  chemical-gene,  gene-disease 
relations, etc. And, we also try to translate those terms to MeSH term and select only 
MeSH  subcategories  shown  in  Table  1.  The  summary  of  these  collected  ontology-
based relations is shown in Table 2.

3.2 

Phase 2: Related Concept Retrieval 

Given a user-specified focal drug, the goal of this phase is to retrieve related relations 
from  the  comprehensive  concept  network  and  to  construct  a  subgraph  for  the  focal 
drug.  In  other  words,  given  a  focal  drug,  we  retrieve  concepts  related  to  the  given 
drug  in  the  network  as  intermediate  terms.  These  intermediate  terms  may  be  gene, 
protein, disease, etc. Then, we extract the disease concepts that related to these inter-
mediate terms but not related to the given drug. 

3.3 

Phase 3: Link Weighting 

Given the extracted subgraph for the user-specified drug, the goal of this phase is to 
weight each link in the subgraph according to different weighting strategies for litera-
ture-based  links  and  ontology-based  links.  We  propose  a  link  weighting  method, 
namely Extended Normalized MEDLINE Similarity (ExtNMS), based on the Norma-
lized Google Distance (NGD) [33] to calculate similarity between MeSH term A and 
B as follows: 

(cid:1840)(cid:1839)(cid:1830)(cid:4666)(cid:1827),(cid:1828)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)(cid:2923)(cid:2911)(cid:2934)(cid:4668)(cid:2922)(cid:2925)(cid:2917)|(cid:3005)(cid:3250)|,(cid:2922)(cid:2925)(cid:2917)|(cid:3005)(cid:3251)|(cid:4669)(cid:2879)(cid:2922)(cid:2925)(cid:2917)|(cid:3005)(cid:3250)(cid:1514)(cid:3005)(cid:3251)|

where DA is the set of articles including MeSH term A, and M denotes the total num-
ber of articles in MEDLINE. This weighting measure ranges from 0 to 1, in which 0 
being completely unrelated and 1 being credibly related. If link (A,B) is from the lite-
rature-based  concept  network  and  is  not  found  in  the  ontology-based  concept  net-
work,  we  weight  it  by  calculating  its  Normalized  MEDLINE  Distance  (NMD)  and 
subtracting from 1, called Normalized MEDLINE Similarity (NMS); otherwise, if the 
link appears in the ontology-based concept network, we assign its weight as 1 since 
this relation should have been validated. 

3.4 

Phase 4: Target Term Ranking 

Yetisgen-Yildiz  &  Pratt  [18]  suggested  that  using  Link  Term  Count  with  Average 
Minimum  Weight  (LTC-AMW)  can  achieve  the  best  effectiveness  for  target  term 
ranking.  LTC-AMW  takes  the  number  of  intermediate  terms  between  starting  term 
and target term as the primary  ranking  criteria, i.e. the number of paths. The average 
minimum  weight  of  paths  is  used  only  when  two  target  terms  are  identical  in  their 
number of paths. In this study, we propose two target term ranking measures, Summa-
tion of Minimum Weight (SumMW)  and  Summation of Average Weight (SumAW), as 
follows: 

S(cid:1873)(cid:1865)(cid:1839)(cid:1849)(cid:4666)(cid:1827),(cid:1829)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)∑

where  N(A)  denotes  the  neighbor  concepts  of  term  A,  and  Wt(A,B)  is  the  weight  of 
link between term A and B. The above measures differentiate the importance of each 
path according to their minimum or average weight of constituent links, and assign an 
importance score to each target term according to the cumulative information of all 
paths  between  the  starting  term  and  the  target  term.  We  then  order  target  terms  ac-
cording to their importance scores.

Evaluation and Results 

In this study, we conduct two experiments to evaluate our proposed method for drug 
repositioning.  The  first  experiment  is  to  evaluate  our  proposed  comprehensive  con-
cept network and link weighting measure (i.e., ExtNMS). The second experiment is to 
evaluate our proposed target term ranking measure. 

4.1  Evaluation Design 

We follow the evaluation procedure proposed by Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt [18]. Spe-
cifically, we describe our experiment procedure step by step in the following.

Given a starting term A (i.e., drug): 

1. We set cut-off date as January 1, 2000 and divide MEDLINE 2011 baseline into 

two datasets: 
(a) Pre-cut-off set (St1) includes the documents prior to 1/1/2000. 
(b) Post-cut-off set (St2) includes the documents on and after 1/1/2000. 

2. The documents in the pre-cut-off set are used along with ontologies as the input to 

construct the comprehensive concept network. 

3. We define a gold-standard set GA, which contains terms that satisfy the  following 

rules: 
(a) Terms are within our specified target semantic group, i.e., disease. 
(b) Terms  co-occur  with  term  A  in  the  post-cut-off  set,  but  do  not  co-occur  with 
term A in the pre-cut-off set. In other words, these terms co-occur with term A 
in literature only after the cut-off date (i.e., 1/1/2000). 

(c) Terms are not related to term A in the ontology-based concept network. 

4. The discovery  effectiveness  is estimated by using the information retrieval metrics 

as follows: 
(a) Precision:   

(b) Recall:

4.2  Exp.  1:  Evaluation  of  the  Comprehensive  Concept  Network  and  Link 

Weighting Method 

The performance benchmark is the original ABC model over only the literature which 
uses association rules as link weighting algorithm  [14]. We evaluate three versions  of 
our  discovery  method,  i.e.,  one  is  over  only  the  literature-based  concept  network,

another  one  is  over  only  the  ontology-based  concept  network,  and  the  third  one  is 
over  the  comprehensive  concept  network.  All  methods  (including  the  benchmark) 
under  investigation  apply  LTC-AMW  as  the  target  term  ranking  measure.  Table  4 
shows  the  evaluation  results,  and  the  Area  Under  Curve  of  Precision  and  Recall 
(AUC-PR) represents the  overall  performance. A higher AUC-PR value represents a 
greater  effectiveness. As  Table  4  illustrates,  our proposed ExtNMS measure outper-
forms the benchmark link weighting measure  (i.e.,  association rules) when  the  infor-
mation  source  is  the  literature  only  or  the  integrated  information  sources  (i.e.,  the 
comprehensive  concept  network  that  contains  literature  and  ontologies). Moreover, 
using both literature and ontologies as information sources improves the  overall per-
formance,  especially  precisions  on  higher  ranks.  This  would  better  help  researchers 
sift plausible drug-disease relations for the purpose of drug repositioning.

4.3  Exp. 2: Evaluation of Target Term Ranking Measure 

In this experiment, we evaluate the proposed target term ranking measures, Summa-
tion  of  Minimum  Weight  (SumMW)  and  Summation  of  Average  Weight  (SumAW). 
Based on the experiment 1, we apply ExtNMS as the link weighting measure in this 
experiment. In  this  experiment,  LTC-AMW is  used  as  the benchmark ranking meas-
ure. Table 8 shows the comparative evaluation results of the three target term ranking 
measures using the comprehensive concept network as the information sources. Both 
SumMW  and  SumAW  outperform  the  benchmark  measure,  LTC-AMW.  These  re-
sults show that our link weighting measure, ExtNMS, is a more effective measure to 
weight links, and considering both the number and weights of paths between the start-
ing term and target terms can improve the discovery effectiveness.

Conclusions 

In this study, we develop a drug repositioning discovery method that uses both bio-
medical  literature  and  ontologies  as  information  sources  for  constructing  a  compre-
hensive network of biomedical concepts. We also  develop  a link  weighting method 
(i.e., ExtNMS) and two target term ranking measures. We experimentally evaluate our 
proposed method and show that taking both literature and ontologies into account and 
using  our  ExtNMS  measure  can improve the effectiveness of predicting novel drug-
disease relationships. Besides, our proposed target term ranking measures  can better 
infer  plausible  drug-disease  relations.  Overall,  our  proposed  drug  repositioning  dis-
covery  method  can  help  researchers  sift  most  plausible  unknown  drug-disease  rela-
tionships, i.e., potential drug repositioning candidates.
